    <p>
      <br /> <span style="color: #555555;">The poems written in 1804 were not
      numerous; and, with the exception of <a href="#section9"><i>The Small
      Celandine</i></a>, the stanzas beginning <a href="#section3">"I wandered
      lonely as a cloud,"</a> and <a href="#section2">"She was a Phantom of
      delight,"</a> they were less remarkable than those of the two preceding,
      and the three following years. Wordsworth's poetical activity in 1804 is
      not recorded, however, in Lyrical Ballads or Sonnets, but in <a
      href="#section24"><i>The Prelude</i></a>, much of which was thought out,
      and afterwards dictated to Dorothy or Mary Wordsworth, on the terrace walk
      of Lancrigg during that year; while the <i>Ode, Intimations of Immortality</i>
      was altered and added to, although it did not receive its final form till
      1806. In the <a href="#24b6">sixth book</a> of <i>The Prelude</i>, p. 222,
      the lines occur:</span> '
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Four years and thirty, told this very week,<br /> Have I been now a
        sojourner on earth.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">That part of the great autobiographical poem
      must therefore have been composed in April, 1804.&mdash;Ed.</span><br />

          She was a Phantom of delight <br /> When first she gleamed upon my
          sight;<br /> A lovely Apparition, sent <br /> To be a moment's ornament;
          <br /> Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair;<br /> Like Twilight's, too,
          her dusky hair; <br /> But all things else about her drawn <br /> From
          May-time and the cheerful Dawn;<br /> A dancing Shape, an Image gay,
          <br /> To haunt, to startle, and way-lay.<br /><br /> I saw her upon
          nearer view, <br /> A Spirit, yet a Woman too! <br /> Her household
          motions light and free, <br /> And steps of virgin-liberty; <br /> A
          countenance in which did meet<br /> Sweet records, promises as sweet;
          <br /> A Creature not too bright or good <br /> For human nature's daily
          food; <br /> For transient sorrows, simple wiles, <br /> Praise, blame,
          love, kisses, tears, and smiles.<br /><br /> And now I see with eye
          serene <br /> The very pulse of the machine; <br /> A Being breathing
          thoughtful breath,<br /> A Traveller between life and death;<br /> The
          reason firm, the temperate will,<br /> Endurance, foresight, strength,
          and skill;<br /> A perfect Woman, nobly planned,<br /> To warn, to

      Wordsworth in <i>The Prelude</i>:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'Another maid there was, who also shed <br /> A gladness o'er that
        season, then to me, <br /> By her exulting outside look of youth <br />
        And placid under-countenance, first endeared;'

        penetrate the lofty and the low;'

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="2n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span
      style="color: #555555;">It is not easy to say what were the "four lines
      composed as a part of the verses on the <i>Highland Girl</i>" which the
      Fenwick note tells us was "the germ of this poem." They may be lines now
      incorporated in those <i>To a Highland Girl</i>, vol. ii. p. 389, or they
      may be lines in the present poem, which Wordsworth wrote at first for the
      <i>Highland Girl</i>, but afterwards transferred to this one. They <i>may</i>
      have been the first four lines of the later poem. The two should be read
      consecutively, and compared.<br /> <br /> After Wordsworth's death, a writer
      in the <i>Daily News</i>, January 1859&mdash;then understood to be Miss
      Harriet Martineau &mdash;wrote thus:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "In the <i>Memoirs</i>, by the nephew of the poet, it is said that these
        verses refer to Mrs. Wordsworth; but for half of Wordsworth's life it
        was always understood that they referred to some other phantom which
        'gleamed upon his sight' before Mary Hutchinson."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">This statement is much more than improbable;
      it is, I think, disproved by the Fenwick note. They cannot refer to the
      "Lucy" of the Goslar poems; and Wordsworth indicates, as plainly as he
      chose, to whom they actually do refer. Compare the Hon. Justice
      Coleridge's account of a conversation with Wordsworth (<i>Memoirs</i>,
      vol. ii. p. 306), in which the poet expressly said that the lines were
      written on his wife. The question was, however, set at rest in a
      conversation of Wordsworth with Henry Crabb Robinson, who wrote in his <i>Diary</i>
      on </span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "<a name="fr2B" id="fr2B">May</a> 12 (1842).&mdash;Wordsworth said that
        the poems 'Our walk was far among the ancient trees' [vol. ii. p. 167],
        then 'She was a Phantom of delight,'<a href="#2B"><sup>B</sup></a> and
        finally the two sonnets <i>To a Painter</i>, should be read in
        succession as exhibiting the different phases of his affection to his
        wife."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">(<i>Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence
      of Henry Crabb Robinson</i>, vol. iii. p. 197.)</span><br /> <br /> The use
      of the word "machine," in the third stanza of the poem, has been much
      criticised, but for a similar use of the term, see the sequel to <a
      href="#section23"><i>The Waggoner</i></a> (p. 107):
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'Forgive me, then; for I had been<br /> On friendly terms with this
        Machine.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">See also <i>Hamlet</i> (act II. scene ii. l.
      124):</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">The progress of mechanical industry in
      Britain since the beginning of the present century has given a more
      limited, and purely technical, meaning to the word, than it bore when
      Wordsworth used it in these two instances.&mdash;Ed.</span><br /> <br />

      1804. The two best lines in it are by Mary. The daffodils grew, and still
      grow, on the margin of Ullswater, and probably may be seen to this day as
      beautiful in the month of March, nodding their golden heads beside the
      dancing and foaming waves.&mdash;I.F.]</span><br /> <br /> <span

          I wandered lonely as a cloud<br /> That floats on high o'er vales and
          hills,<br /> When all at once I saw a crowd,<br /> A host, of golden
          daffodils;<br /> Beside the lake, beneath the trees, <br /> Fluttering
          and dancing in the breeze.<br /><br /> Continuous as the stars that
          shine<br /> And twinkle on the milky way,<br /> They stretched in
          never-ending line<br /> Along the margin of a bay: <br /> Ten thousand
          saw I at a glance, <br /> Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br /><br />
          The waves beside them danced; but they<br /> Out-did the sparkling
          waves in glee:<br /> A poet could not but be gay, <br /> In such a
          jocund company:<br /> I gazed&mdash;and gazed&mdash;but little thought<br />
          What wealth the show to me had brought:<br /><br /> For oft, when on my
          couch I lie<br /> In vacant or in pensive mood, <br /> They flash upon
          that inward eye<br /> Which is the bliss of solitude;<br /> And then my
          heart with pleasure fills,<br /> And dances with the daffodils.<br />

      <br /> <br /> <a name="3n1"></a><i>Note:</i> &nbsp; <span
      style="color: #555555;">The following is from Dorothy Wordsworth's
      Journal, under date, Thursday, April 15, 1802:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park, we saw a few daffodils
        close to the water side. We fancied that the sea had floated the seeds
        ashore, and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as we went
        along there were more, and yet more; and, at last, under the boughs of
        the trees, we saw that there was a long belt of them along the shore,
        about the breadth of a country turnpike road. I never saw daffodils so
        beautiful. They grew among the mossy stones, about and above them; some
        rested their heads upon these stones, as on a pillow for weariness; and
        the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed as if they verily
        laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake. They looked so
        gay, ever glancing, ever changing. This wind blew directly over the lake
        to them. There was here and there a little knot, and a few stragglers
        higher up; but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity, unity,
        and life of that one busy highway. We rested again and again. The bays
        were stormy, and we heard the waves at different distances, and in the
        middle of the water, like the sea...."
      </p>

    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">In <a name="fr3A" id="fr3A">the</a> edition

      </p>

    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">to the following effect:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The subject of these Stanzas is rather an elementary feeling and simple
        impression (approaching to the nature of an ocular spectrum) upon the
        imaginative faculty, than an exertion of it. The one which follows<a
        href="#3A"><sup>A</sup></a> is strictly a Reverie; and neither that, nor
        the next after it in succession, <i>Power of Music</i>, would have been
        placed here except for the reason given in the foregoing note."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">The <a name="fr3B" id="fr3B">being</a>
      "placed here" refers to its being included among the "Poems of the
      Imagination." The "foregoing note" is the note appended to 'The Horn of
      Egremont Castle'; and the "reason given" in it is "to avoid a needless
      multiplication of the Classes" into which Wordsworth divided his poems.
      This note of 181?<a href="#3B"><sup>B</sup></a>, is reprinted mainly to
      show the difficulties to which Wordsworth was reduced by the artificial
      method of arrangement referred to. The following letter to Mr. Wrangham is
      a more appropriate illustration of the poem of "The Daffodils." It was
      written, the late Bishop of Lincoln says, "sometime afterwards." (See <i>Memoirs
      of Wordsworth</i>, vol. i. pp. 183, 184); and, for the whole of the
      letter, see a subsequent volume of this edition.</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "<b>Grasmere</b>, Nov. 4.<br /> <br /> "<b>My Dear Wrangham</b>,&mdash;I
        am indeed much pleased that Mrs. Wrangham and yourself have been
        gratified by these breathings of simple nature. You mention Butler,
        Montagu's friend; not Tom Butler, but the conveyancer: when I was in
        town in spring, he happened to see the volumes lying on Montagu's
        mantelpiece, and to glance his eye upon the very poem of <i>The
        Daffodils.</i> 'Aye,' says he, 'a fine morsel this for the Reviewers.'
        When this was told me (for I was not present) I observed that there were
        'two lines' in that little poem which, if thoroughly felt, would
        annihilate nine-tenths of the reviews of the kingdom, as they would find
        no readers. The lines I alluded to were these:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'They flash upon that inward eye<br /> Which is the bliss of
          solitude.'"
        </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">These two lines were composed by Mrs.
      Wordsworth. In 1877 the daffodils were still growing in abundance on the
      shore of Ullswater, below Gowbarrow Park.<br /> <br /> Compare the last four
      lines of James Montgomery's poem, <i>The Little Cloud</i>:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'Bliss in possession will not last:<br /> Remembered joys are never past:<br />
        At once the fountain, stream, and sea,<br /> They were&mdash;they are&mdash;they
        yet shall be.'

      <a href="#section5a">The Poem</a><br /> <br /> <span style="color: #663300;">[This
      was an overflow from 'The Affliction of Margaret', and was excluded as
      superfluous there, but preserved in the faint hope that it may turn to
      account by restoring a shy lover to some forsaken damsel. My poetry has
      been complained of as deficient in interests of this sort,&mdash;a charge
      which the piece beginning, "Lyre! though such power do in thy magic live,"
      will scarcely tend to obviate. The natural imagery of these verses was
      supplied by frequent, I might say intense, observation of the Rydal
      torrent. What an animating contrast is the ever-changing aspect of that,
      and indeed of every one of our mountain brooks, to the monotonous tone and
      unmitigated fury of such streams among the Alps as are fed all the summer
      long by glaciers and melting snows. A traveller observing the exquisite
      purity of the great rivers, such as the Rhone at Geneva, and the Reuss at
      Lucerne, when they issue out of their respective lakes, might fancy for a
      moment that some power in nature produced this beautiful change, with a
      view to make amends for those Alpine sullyings which the waters exhibit
      near their fountain heads; but, alas! how soon does that purity depart
      before the influx of tributary waters that have flowed through cultivated
      plains and the crowded abodes of men.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br /> <br /> <span

          The fields which with covetous spirit we sold,<br /> Those beautiful
          fields, the delight of the day,<br /> Would have brought us more good
          than a burthen of gold,<br /> Could we but have been as contented as
          they.<br /><br /> When the troublesome Tempter beset us, said I,<br />

          Allan, be true to me, Allan,&mdash;we'll die<br /> Before he shall go

          We could do what we liked with the land, it was ours;<br /> And for us

          strangers, go early or late;<br /> And often, like one overburthened
          with sin,<br /> With my hand on the latch of the half-opened gate,<br />
          I look at the fields, but I cannot go in!<br /><br /> When I walk by the
          hedge on a bright summer's day,<br /> Or sit in the shade of my
          grandfather's tree,<br /> A stern face it puts on, as if ready to say,<br />
          "What ails you, that you must come creeping to me!"<br /><br /> With our
          pastures about us, we could not be sad;<br /> Our comfort was near if
          we ever were crost;<br /> But the comfort, the blessings, and wealth
          that we had,<br /> We slighted them all,&mdash;and our birth-right was
          lost.<br /><br /> Oh, ill-judging sire of an innocent son<br /> Who must
          now be a wanderer! but peace to that strain!<br /> Think of evening's
          repose when our labour was done,<br /> The sabbath's return; and its
          leisure's soft chain!<br /><br /> And in sickness, if night had been
          sparing of sleep,<br /> How cheerful, at sunrise, the hill where I
          stood,<br /> Looking down on the kine, and our treasure of sheep<br />
          That besprinkled the field; 'twas like youth in my blood!<br /><br />
          Now I cleave to the house, and am dull as a snail;<br /> And,
          oftentimes, hear the church-bell with a sigh,<br /> That follows the
          thought&mdash;We've no land in the vale,<br /> Save six feet of earth

          &mdash;Hast thou then survived&mdash;<br /> Mild Offspring of infirm
          humanity,<br /> Meek Infant! among all forlornest things<br /> The most
          forlorn&mdash;one life of that bright star,<br /> The second glory of
          the Heavens?&mdash;Thou hast;<br /> Already hast survived that great
          decay,<br /> That transformation through the wide earth felt,<br /> And
          by all nations. In that Being's sight<br /> From whom the Race of human
          kind proceed,<br /> A thousand years are but as yesterday;<br /> And one
          day's narrow circuit is to Him<br /> Not less capacious than a thousand
          years.<br /> But what is time? What outward glory? neither<br /> A
          measure is of Thee, whose claims extend<br /> Through "heaven's eternal
          year."&mdash;Yet hail to Thee,<br /> Frail, feeble, Monthling!&mdash;by
          that name, methinks,<br /> Thy scanty breathing-time is portioned out<br />
          Not idly.&mdash;Hadst thou been of Indian birth,<br /> Couched on a
          casual bed of moss and leaves,<br /> And rudely canopied by leafy
          boughs,<br /> Or to the churlish elements exposed<br /> On the blank
          plains,&mdash;the coldness of the night,<br /> Or the night's darkness,
          or its cheerful face<br /> Of beauty, by the changing moon adorned,<br />
          Would, with imperious admonition, then<br /> Have scored thine age, and
          punctually timed<br /> Thine infant history, on the minds of those<br />
          Who might have wandered with thee.&mdash;Mother's love,<br /> Nor less
          than mother's love in other breasts,<br /> Will, among us warm-clad and
          warmly housed,<br /> Do for thee what the finger of the heavens<br />
          Doth all too often harshly execute<br /> For thy unblest coevals, amid
          wilds<br /> Where fancy hath small liberty to grace<br /> The
          affections, to exalt them or refine;<br /> And the maternal sympathy
          itself,<br /> Though strong, is, in the main, a joyless tie<br /> Of
          naked instinct, wound about the heart.<br /> Happier, far happier is
          thy lot and ours!<br /> Even now&mdash;to solemnise thy helpless state,<br />
          And to enliven in the mind's regard<br /> Thy passive beauty&mdash;parallels
          have risen,<br /> Resemblances, or contrasts, that connect,<br /> Within
          the region of a father's thoughts,<br /> Thee and thy mate and sister
          of the sky.<br /> And first;&mdash;thy sinless progress, through a
          world<br /> By sorrow darkened and by care disturbed,<br /> Apt likeness
          bears to hers, through gathered clouds,<br /> Moving untouched in
          silver purity,<br /> And cheering oft-times their reluctant gloom.<br />
          Fair are ye both, and both are free from stain:<br /> But thou, how
          leisurely thou fill'st thy horn<br /> With brightness! leaving her to
          post along,<br /> And range about, disquieted in change,<br /> And still
          impatient of the shape she wears.<br /> Once up, once down the hill,
          one journey, Babe<br /> That will suffice thee; and it seems that now<br />
          Thou hast fore-knowledge that such task is thine;<br /> Thou travellest
          so contentedly, and sleep'st <br /> In such a heedless peace. Alas!
          full soon<br /> Hath this conception, grateful to behold,<br /> Changed
          countenance, like an object sullied o'er<br /> By breathing mist; and
          thine appears to be<br /> A mournful labour, while to her is given<br />
          Hope, and a renovation without end.<br /> &mdash;That smile forbids the
          thought; for on thy face<br /> Smiles are beginning, like the beams of
          dawn,<br /> To shoot and circulate; smiles have there been seen;<br />
          Tranquil assurances that Heaven supports<br /> The feeble motions of
          thy life, and cheers<br /> Thy loneliness: or shall those smiles be
          called<br /> Feelers of love, put forth as if to explore<br /> This
          untried world, and to prepare thy way<br /> Through a strait passage
          intricate and dim?<br /> Such are they; and the same are tokens, signs,<br />
          Which, when the appointed season hath arrived,<br /> Joy, as her
          holiest language, shall adopt;<br /> And Reason's godlike Power be
          proud to own.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="#7n1">Note</a><br /> <a

          That way look, my Infant, lo!<br /> What a pretty baby-show!<br /> See
          the Kitten on the wall,<br /> Sporting with the leaves that fall,<br />
          Withered leaves&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;and three&mdash;<br /> From
          the lofty elder-tree!<br /> Through the calm and frosty air<br /> Of
          this morning bright and fair,<br /> Eddying round and round they sink<br />
          Softly, slowly: one might think,<br /> From the motions that are made,<br />
          Every little leaf conveyed<br /> Sylph or Faery hither tending,&mdash;<br />
          To this lower world descending,<br /> Each invisible and mute,<br /> In
          his wavering parachute.<br /> &mdash;&mdash;But the Kitten, how she
          starts,<br /> Crouches, stretches, paws, and darts!<br /> First at one,
          and then its fellow<br /> Just as light and just as yellow;<br /> There
          are many now&mdash;now one&mdash;<br /> Now they stop and there are
          none:<br /> What intenseness of desire<br /> In her upward eye of fire!<br />
          With a tiger-leap half-way<br /> Now she meets the coming prey,<br />
          Lets it go as fast, and then<br /> Has it in her power again:<br /> Now
          she works with three or four,<br /> Like an Indian conjurer;<br /> Quick
          as he in feats of art,<br /> Far beyond in joy of heart.<br /> Were her
          antics played in the eye<br /> Of a thousand standers-by,<br /> Clapping
          hands with shout and stare,<br /> What would little Tabby care<br /> For

          wealthy in the treasure<br /> Of her own exceeding pleasure!<br /><br />

          (In the sun or under shade,<br /> Upon bough or grassy blade)<br /> And
          with busy revellings,<br /> Chirp and song, and murmurings,<br /> Made

          Multitudes are swept away<br /> Never more to breathe the day:<br />
          Some are sleeping; some in bands<br /> Travelled into distant lands;<br />
          Others slunk to moor and wood,<br /> Far from human neighbourhood;<br />
          And, among the Kinds that keep<br /> With us closer fellowship,<br />
          With us openly abide,<br /> All have laid their mirth aside.<br /><br />
          Where is he that giddy Sprite,<br /> Blue-cap, with his colours bright,<br />
          Who was blest as bird could be,<br /> Feeding in the apple-tree;<br />
          Made such wanton spoil and rout,<br /> Turning blossoms inside out;<br />
          Hung&mdash;head pointing towards the ground&mdash;<br /> Fluttered,
          perched, into a round<br /> Bound himself, and then unbound;<br />
          Lithest, gaudiest Harlequin!<br /> Prettiest tumbler ever seen!<br />
          Light of heart and light of limb;<br /> What is now become of Him?<br />
          Lambs, that through the mountains went<br /> Frisking, bleating
          merriment,<br /> When the year was in its prime,<br /> They are sobered
          by this time.<br /> If you look to vale or hill,<br /> If you listen,
          all is still,<br /> Save a little neighbouring rill,<br /> That from out
          the rocky ground<br /> Strikes a solitary sound.<br /> Vainly glitter
          hill and plain,<br /> And the air is calm in vain;<br /> Vainly Morning
          spreads the lure<br /> Of a sky serene and pure;<br /> Creature none can
          she decoy<br /> Into open sign of joy:<br /> Is it that they have a fear<br />
          Of the dreary season near?<br /> Or that other pleasures be<br />
          Sweeter even than gaiety?<br /><br /> Yet, whate'er enjoyments dwell<br />
          In the impenetrable cell<br /> Of the silent heart which Nature<br />
          Furnishes to every creature;<br /> Whatsoe'er we feel and know<br /> Too

          Pretty Kitten! from thy freaks,&mdash;<br /> Spreads with such a living
          grace<br /> O'er my little Dora's face;<br /> Yes, the sight so stirs
          and charms<br /> Thee, Baby, laughing in my arms,<br /> That almost I

          Now and then I may possess<br /> Hours of perfect gladsomeness.<br />
          &mdash;Pleased by any random toy;<br /> By a kitten's busy joy,<br /> Or
          an infant's laughing eye<br /> Sharing in the ecstasy;<br /> I would
          fare like that or this,<br /> Find my wisdom in my bliss;<br /> Keep the
          sprightly soul awake,<br /> And have faculties to take,<br /> Even from
          things by sorrow wrought,<br /> Matter for a jocund thought,<br /> Spite
          of care, and spite of grief,<br /> To gambol with Life's falling Leaf.<br />

          There is a Flower, the lesser Celandine,<br /> That shrinks, like many

          shower, nor seek the cold:<br /> This neither is its courage nor its
          choice,<br /> But its necessity in being old.<br /><br /> "The sunshine

          decay;<br /> Stiff in its members, withered, changed of hue."<br /> And,
          in my spleen, I smiled that it was grey.<br /><br /> To be a Prodigal's
          Favourite&mdash;then, worse truth,<br /> A Miser's Pensioner&mdash;behold

      was presented to me by Sir George Beaumont, with a view to the erection of
      a house upon it, for the sake of being near to Coleridge, then living, and
      likely to remain, at Greta Hall, near Keswick. The severe necessities that
      prevented this arose from his domestic situation. This little property,
      with a considerable addition that still leaves it very small, lies
      beautifully upon the banks of a rill that gurgles down the side of
      Skiddaw; and the orchard and other parts of the grounds command a
      magnificent prospect of Derwent Water, the mountains of Borrowdale and

          O happy time of youthful lovers (thus<br /> My story may begin) O balmy
          time,<br /> In which a love-knot on a lady's brow<br /> Is fairer than
          the fairest star in heaven!<br /> To such inheritance of blessed fancy
          <br /> (Fancy that sports more desperately with minds<br /> Than ever
          fortune hath been known to do)<br /> The high-born Vaudracour was
          brought, by years<br /> Whose progress had a little overstepped<br />
          His stripling prime. A town of small repute, <br /> Among the vine-clad
          mountains of Auvergne,<br /> Was the Youth's birth-place. There he
          wooed a Maid<br /> Who heard the heart-felt music of his suit<br /> With
          answering vows. Plebeian was the stock,<br /> Plebeian, though
          ingenuous, the stock, <br /> From which her graces and her honours
          sprung:<br /> And hence the father of the enamoured Youth,<br /> With
          haughty indignation, spurned the thought<br /> Of such alliance.&mdash;From
          their cradles up,<br /> With but a step between their several homes,
          <br /> Twins had they been in pleasure; after strife<br /> And petty
          quarrels, had grown fond again;<br /> Each other's advocate, each
          other's stay;<br /> And, in their happiest moments, not content,<br />
          If more divided than a sportive pair <br /> Of sea-fowl, conscious both
          that they are hovering<br /> Within the eddy of a common blast,<br /> Or
          hidden only by the concave depth<br /> Of neighbouring billows from
          each other's sight.<br /><br /> Thus, not without concurrence of an age
          <br /> Unknown to memory, was an earnest given<br /> By ready nature for
          a life of love,<br /> For endless constancy, and placid truth;<br /> But
          whatsoe'er of such rare treasure lay<br /> Reserved, had fate
          permitted, for support <br /> Of their maturer years, his present mind<br />
          Was under fascination;&mdash;he beheld<br /> A vision, and adored the
          thing he saw.<br /> Arabian fiction never filled the world<br /> With
          half the wonders that were wrought for him. <br /> Earth breathed in
          one great presence of the spring;<br /> Life turned the meanest of her
          implements,<br /> Before his eyes, to price above all gold;<br /> The
          house she dwelt in was a sainted shrine;<br /> Her chamber-window did
          surpass in glory <br /> The portals of the dawn; all paradise<br />
          Could, by the simple opening of a door,<br /> Let itself in upon him:&mdash;pathways,
          walks,<br /> Swarmed with enchantment, till his spirit sank,<br />
          Surcharged, within him, overblest to move <br /> Beneath a sun that
          wakes a weary world<br /> To its dull round of ordinary cares;<br /> A
          man too happy for mortality!<br /><br /> So passed the time, till
          whether through effect<br /> Of some unguarded moment that dissolved
          <br /> Virtuous restraint&mdash;ah, speak it, think it, not!<br /> Deem
          rather that the fervent Youth, who saw<br /> So many bars between his
          present state<br /> And the dear haven where he wished to be<br /> In
          honourable wedlock with his Love, <br /> Was in his judgment tempted to
          decline<br /> To perilous weakness, and entrust his cause<br /> To
          nature for a happy end of all;<br /> Deem that by such fond hope the
          Youth was swayed,<br /> And bear with their transgression, when I add
          <br /> That Julia, wanting yet the name of wife,<br /> Carried about her
          for a secret grief<br /> The promise of a mother.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To conceal<br /> The threatened
          shame, the parents of the Maid<br /> Found means to hurry her away by
          night, <br /> And unforewarned, that in some distant spot<br /> She
          might remain shrouded in privacy,<br /> Until the babe was born. When
          morning came,<br /> The Lover, thus bereft, stung with his loss,<br />
          And all uncertain whither he should turn, <br /> Chafed like a wild
          beast in the toils; but soon<br /> Discovering traces of the fugitives,<br />
          Their steps he followed to the Maid's retreat.<br /> Easily may the
          sequel be divined&mdash;<br /> Walks to and fro&mdash;watchings at
          every hour; <br /> And the fair Captive, who, whene'er she may,<br /> Is
          busy at her casement as the swallow<br /> Fluttering its pinions,
          almost within reach,<br /> About the pendent nest, did thus espy<br />
          Her Lover!&mdash;thence a stolen interview, <br /> Accomplished under
          friendly shade of night.<br /><br /> I pass the raptures of the pair;&mdash;such
          theme<br /> Is, by innumerable poets, touched<br /> In more delightful
          verse than skill of mine<br /> Could fashion; chiefly by that darling
          bard <br /> Who told of Juliet and her Romeo,<br /> And of the lark's
          note heard before its time,<br /> And of the streaks that laced the
          severing clouds<br /> In the unrelenting east.&mdash;Through all her
          courts<br /> The vacant city slept; the busy winds, <br /> That keep no
          certain intervals of rest,<br /> Moved not; meanwhile the galaxy
          displayed<br /> Her fires, that like mysterious pulses beat<br /> Aloft;&mdash;momentous
          but uneasy bliss!<br /> To their full hearts the universe seemed hung
          <br /> On that brief meeting's slender filament!<br /><br /> They parted;
          and the generous Vaudracour<br /> Reached speedily the native
          threshold, bent<br /> On making (so the Lovers had agreed)<br /> A
          sacrifice of birthright to attain <br /> A final portion from his
          father's hand;<br /> Which granted, Bride and Bridegroom then would
          flee<br /> To some remote and solitary place,<br /> Shady as night, and
          beautiful as heaven,<br /> Where they may live, with no one to behold
          <br /> Their happiness, or to disturb their love.<br /> But <i>now</i>
          of this no whisper; not the less,<br /> If ever an obtrusive word were
          dropped<br /> Touching the matter of his passion, still,<br /> In his
          stern father's hearing, Vaudracour <br /> Persisted openly that death
          alone<br /> Should abrogate his human privilege<br /> Divine, of
          swearing everlasting truth,<br /> Upon the altar, to the Maid he loved.<br /><br />
          "You shall be baffled in your mad intent <br /> If there be justice in
          the court of France,"<br /> Muttered the Father.&mdash;From these words
          the Youth <br /> Conceived a terror; and, by night or day,<br /> Stirred
          nowhere without weapons, that full soon<br /> Found dreadful
          provocation: for at night <br /> When to his chamber he retired,
          attempt<br /> Was made to seize him by three arm&egrave;d men,<br />
          Acting, in furtherance of the father's will,<br /> Under a private
          signet of the State.<br /> One the rash Youth's ungovernable hand <br />
          Slew, and as quickly to a second gave <br /> A perilous wound&mdash;he
          shuddered to behold<br /> The breathless corse; then peacefully
          resigned<br /> His person to the law, was lodged in prison,<br /> And
          wore the fetters of a criminal. <br /><br /> Have you observed a tuft of
          wing&egrave;d seed<br /> That, from the dandelion's naked stalk,<br />
          Mounted aloft, is suffered not to use<br /> Its natural gifts for
          purposes of rest,<br /> Driven by the autumnal whirlwind to and fro
          <br /> Through the wide element? or have you marked<br /> The heavier
          substance of a leaf-clad bough,<br /> Within the vortex of a foaming
          flood,<br /> Tormented? by such aid you may conceive<br /> The
          perturbation that ensued; &mdash;ah, no! <br /> Desperate the Maid&mdash;the
          Youth is stained with blood;<br /> Unmatchable on earth is their
          disquiet! <br /> Yet as the troubled seed and tortured bough<br /> Is
          Man, subjected to despotic sway.<br /><br /> For him, by private
          influence with the Court, <br /> Was pardon gained, and liberty
          procured;<br /> But not without exaction of a pledge,<br /> Which
          liberty and love dispersed in air.<br /> He flew to her from whom they
          would divide him&mdash;<br /> He clove to her who could not give him
          peace&mdash; <br /> Yea, his first word of greeting was,&mdash;"All
          right<br /> Is gone from me; my lately-towering hopes,<br /> To the
          least fibre of their lowest root,<br /> Are withered; thou no longer
          canst be mine,<br /> I thine&mdash;the conscience-stricken must not woo
          <br /> The unruffled Innocent,&mdash;I see thy face,<br /> Behold thee,
          and my misery is complete!"<br /><br /> "One, are we not?" exclaimed the
          Maiden&mdash;"One,<br /> For innocence and youth, for weal and woe?"<br />
          Then with the father's name she coupled words <br /> Of vehement
          indignation; but the Youth<br /> Checked her with filial meekness; for
          no thought<br /> Uncharitable crossed his mind, no sense<br /> Of hasty
          anger rising in the eclipse <br /> Of true domestic loyalty, did e'er
          <br /> Find place within his bosom.&mdash;Once again<br /> The
          persevering wedge of tyranny<br /> Achieved their separation: and once
          more<br /> Were they united,&mdash;to be yet again<br /> Disparted,
          pitiable lot! But here <br /> A portion of the tale may well be left<br />
          In silence, though my memory could add<br /> Much how the Youth, in
          scanty space of time,<br /> Was traversed from without; much, too, of
          thoughts<br /> That occupied his days in solitude <br /> Under privation
          and restraint; and what,<br /> Through dark and shapeless fear of
          things to come,<br /> And what, through strong compunction for the
          past,<br /> He suffered&mdash;breaking down in heart and mind!<br /><br />
          Doomed to a third and last captivity, <br /> His freedom he recovered
          on the eve<br /> Of Julia's travail. When the babe was born,<br /> Its
          presence tempted him to cherish schemes<br /> Of future happiness. "You
          shall return,<br /> Julia," said he, "and to your father's house <br />
          Go with the child.&mdash;You have been wretched; yet<br /> The silver
          shower, whose reckless burthen weighs<br /> Too heavily upon the lily's
          head,<br /> Oft leaves a saving moisture at its root.<br /> Malice,
          beholding you, will melt away. <br /> Go!&mdash;'tis a town where both
          of us were born;<br /> None will reproach you, for our truth is known;<br />
          And if, amid those once-bright bowers, our fate<br /> Remain unpitied,
          pity is not in man.<br /> With ornaments&mdash;the prettiest, nature
          yields <br /> Or art can fashion, shall you deck our boy,<br /> And feed
          his countenance with your own sweet looks<br /> Till no one can resist
          him.&mdash;Now, even now,<br /> I see him sporting on the sunny lawn;<br />
          My father from the window sees him too; <br /> Startled, as if some
          new-created thing<br /> Enriched the earth, or Faery of the woods<br />
          Bounded before him;&mdash;but the unweeting Child<br /> Shall by his
          beauty win his grandsire's heart<br /> So that it shall be softened,
          and our loves <br /> End happily, as they began!"<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These gleams<br /> Appeared but
          seldom; oftener was he seen<br /> Propping a pale and melancholy face<br />
          Upon the Mother's bosom; resting thus<br /> His head upon one breast,
          while from the other <br /> The Babe was drawing in its quiet food.<br />
          &mdash;That pillow is no longer to be thine,<br /> Fond Youth! that
          mournful solace now must pass<br /> Into the list of things that cannot
          be!<br /> Unwedded Julia, terror-smitten, hears <br /> The sentence, by
          her mother's lip pronounced,<br /> That dooms her to a convent.&mdash;Who
          shall tell,<br /> Who dares report, the tidings to the lord<br /> Of her
          affections? so they blindly asked<br /> Who knew not to what quiet
          depths a weight <br /> Of agony had pressed the Sufferer down:<br /> The
          word, by others dreaded, he can hear<br /> Composed and silent, without
          visible sign<br /> Of even the least emotion. Noting this,<br /> When
          the impatient object of his love <br /> Upbraided him with slackness,
          he returned<br /> No answer, only took the mother's hand<br /> And
          kissed it; seemingly devoid of pain,<br /> Or care, that what so
          tenderly he pressed<br /> Was a dependant on the obdurate heart <br />
          Of one who came to disunite their lives<br /> For ever&mdash;sad
          alternative! preferred,<br /> By the unbending Parents of the Maid,<br />
          To secret 'spousals meanly disavowed.<br /> &mdash;So be it!<br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the city
          he remained <br /> A season after Julia had withdrawn<br /> To those
          religious walls. He, too, departs&mdash;<br /> Who with him?&mdash;even
          the senseless Little-one.<br /> With that sole charge he passed the
          city-gates,<br /> For the last time, attendant by the side <br /> Of a
          close chair, a litter, or sedan,<br /> In which the Babe was carried.
          To a hill,<br /> That rose a brief league distant from the town,<br />
          The dwellers in that house where he had lodged<br /> Accompanied his
          steps, by anxious love <br /> Impelled;&mdash;they parted from him
          there, and stood<br /> Watching below till he had disappeared<br /> On
          the hill top. His eyes he scarcely took,<br /> Throughout that journey,
          from the vehicle<br /> (Slow-moving ark of all his hopes!) that veiled
          <br /> The tender infant: and at every inn,<br /> And under every
          hospitable tree<br /> At which the bearers halted or reposed,<br /> Laid
          him with timid care upon his knees,<br /> And looked, as mothers ne'er
          were known to look,<br /> Upon the nursling which his arms embraced.
          <br /><br /> This was the manner in which Vaudracour<br /> Departed with
          his infant; and thus reached<br /> His father's house, where to the
          innocent child<br /> Admittance was denied. The young man spake<br /> No
          word of indignation or reproof, <br /> But of his father begged, a last
          request,<br /> That a retreat might be assigned to him<br /> Where in
          forgotten quiet he might dwell,<br /> With such allowance as his wants
          required; <br /> For wishes he had none. To a lodge that stood<br />
          Deep in a forest, with leave given, at the age<br /> Of four-and-twenty
          summers he withdrew;<br /> And thither took with him his motherless
          Babe, <br /> And one domestic for their common needs, <br /> An aged
          woman. It consoled him here<br /> To attend upon the orphan, and
          perform<br /> Obsequious service to the precious child,<br /> Which,
          after a short time, by some mistake<br /> Or indiscretion of the
          Father, died.&mdash; <br /> The Tale I follow to its last recess<br />
          Of suffering or of peace, I know not which:<br /> Theirs be the blame
          who caused the woe, not mine!<br /><br /> From this time forth he never
          shared a smile<br /> With mortal creature. An Inhabitant <br /> Of that
          same town, in which the pair had left<br /> So lively a remembrance of
          their griefs,<br /> By chance of business, coming within reach<br /> Of
          his retirement, to the forest lodge<br /> Repaired, but only found the
          matron there, <br /> Who told him that his pains were thrown away,<br />
          For that her Master never uttered word<br /> To living thing&mdash;not
          even to her.&mdash;Behold!<br /> While they were speaking, Vaudracour
          approached;<br /> But, seeing some one near, as on the latch <br /> Of
          the garden-gate his hand was laid, he shrunk&mdash;<br /> And, like a
          shadow, glided out of view.<br /> Shocked at his savage aspect, from
          the place<br /> The visitor retired.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus lived the Youth<br /> Cut
          off from all intelligence with man, <br /> And shunning even the light
          of common day;<br /> Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through
          France<br /> Full speedily resounded, public hope,<br /> Or personal
          memory of his own deep wrongs,<br /> Rouse him: but in those solitary
          shades <br /> His days he wasted, an imbecile mind!<br /> <br /> <br />

          Oh! pleasant exercise of hope and joy!<br /> For mighty were the
          auxiliars which then stood<br /> Upon our side, we who were strong in
          love!<br /> Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,<br /> But to be young
          was very heaven!&mdash;Oh! times, <br /> In which the meagre, stale,
          forbidding ways<br /> Of custom, law, and statute, took at once<br />
          The attraction of a country in romance!<br /> When Reason seemed the
          most to assert her rights,<br /> When most intent on making of herself
          <br /> A prime Enchantress&mdash;to assist the work,<br /> Which then
          was going forward in her name!<br /> Not favoured spots alone, but the
          whole earth,<br /> The beauty wore of promise, that which sets<br /> (As
          at some moment might not be unfelt <br /> Among the bowers of paradise
          itself)<br /> The budding rose above the rose full blown.<br /> What
          temper at the prospect did not wake<br /> To happiness unthought of?
          The inert<br /> Were roused, and lively natures rapt away! <br /> They
          who had fed their childhood upon dreams,<br /> The playfellows of
          fancy, who had made<br /> All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and
          strength<br /> Their ministers,&mdash;who in lordly wise had stirred<br />
          Among the grandest objects of the sense, <br /> And dealt with
          whatsoever they found there<br /> As if they had within some lurking
          right<br /> To wield it;&mdash;they, too, who, of gentle mood,<br /> Had
          watched all gentle motions, and to these<br /> Had fitted their own
          thoughts, schemers more mild, <br /> And in the region of their
          peaceful selves;&mdash;<br /> Now was it that both found, the meek and
          lofty<br /> Did both find, helpers to their heart's desire,<br /> And
          stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish;<br /> Were called upon to
          exercise their skill, <br /> Not in Utopia, subterranean fields,<br />
          Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!<br /> But in the very
          world, which is the world<br /> Of all of us,&mdash;the place where in
          the end<br /> We find our happiness, or not at all!<br /> <br /> <br />

      Many and many a time have I been twitted by my wife and sister for having
      forgotten this dedication of myself to the stern law-giver. Transgressor
      indeed I have been from hour to hour, from day to day: I would fain hope,
      however, not more flagrantly, or in a worse way than most of my tuneful
      brethren. But these last words are in a wrong strain. We should be
      rigorous to ourselves, and forbearing, if not indulgent, to others; and,
      if we make comparison at all, it ought to be with those who have morally
      excelled us.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br /> <br /> In pencil on the MS.,

          Stern Daughter of the Voice of God!<br /> O Duty! if that name thou
          love<br /> Who art a light to guide, a rod<br /> To check the erring,
          and reprove;<br /> Thou, who art victory and law <br /> When empty
          terrors overawe;<br /> From vain temptations dost set free;<br /> And
          calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity! <br /><br /> There are who
          ask not if thine eye<br /> Be on them; who, in love and truth, <br />
          Where no misgiving is, rely<br /> Upon the genial sense of youth: <br />
          Glad Hearts! without reproach or blot;<br /> Who do thy work, and know
          it not:<br /> Oh, if through confidence misplaced <br /> They fail, thy
          saving arms, dread Power! around them cast. <br /><br /> Serene will be
          our days and bright,<br /> And happy will our nature be,<br /> When love
          is an unerring light,<br /> And joy its own security. <br /> And they a
          blissful course may hold<br /> Even now, who, not unwisely bold, <br />
          Live in the spirit of this creed;<br /> Yet seek thy firm support,
          according to their need.<br /><br /> I, loving freedom, and untried;
          <br /> No sport of every random gust,<br /> Yet being to myself a guide,<br />
          Too blindly have reposed my trust:<br /> And oft, when in my heart was
          heard<br /> Thy timely mandate, I deferred <br /> The task, in smoother
          walks to stray; <br /> But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I
          may.<br /><br /> Through no disturbance of my soul,<br /> Or strong
          compunction in me wrought,<br /> I supplicate for thy control; <br />
          But in the quietness of thought:<br /> Me this unchartered freedom
          tires; <br /> I feel the weight of chance-desires:<br /> My hopes no
          more must change their name,<br /> I long for a repose that ever is the
          same. <br /> <br /> Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear<br /> The
          Godhead's most benignant grace;<br /> Nor know we any thing so fair<br />
          As is the smile upon thy face: <br /> Flowers laugh before thee on
          their beds <br /> And fragrance in thy footing treads; <br /> Thou dost
          preserve the stars from wrong;<br /> And the most ancient heavens,
          through Thee, are fresh and strong.<br /><br /> To humbler functions,
          awful Power!<br /> I call thee: I myself commend <br /> Unto thy
          guidance from this hour;<br /> Oh, let my weakness have an end!<br />
          Give unto me, made lowly wise,<br /> The spirit of self-sacrifice;<br />
          The confidence of reason give; <br /> And in the light of truth thy
          Bondman let me live! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="#14n1">Note</a><br />

          I, with my fate contented, will plod on, <br /> And hope for higher

      young man whose death gave occasion to this poem was named Charles Gough,
      and had come early in the spring to Patterdale for the sake of angling.
      While attempting to cross over Helvellyn to Grasmere he slipped from a
      steep part of the rock where the ice was not thawed, and perished. His
      body was discovered as described in this poem. Walter Scott heard of the
      accident, and both he and I, without either of us knowing that the other
      had taken up the subject, each wrote a poem in admiration of the dog's
      fidelity. His contains a most beautiful stanza:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "How long did'st thou think that his silence was slumber!<br /> When the
        wind waved his garment how oft did'st thou start!"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #663300;">I will add that the sentiment in the last
      four lines of the last stanza of my verses was uttered by a shepherd with
      such exactness, that a traveller, who afterwards reported his account in
      print, was induced to question the man whether he had read them, which he
      had not.&mdash;I. F.]</span><br /> <br /> <span style="color: #555555;">One

          A barking sound the Shepherd hears,<br /> A cry as of a dog or fox;<br />
          He halts&mdash;and searches with his eyes<br /> Among the scattered
          rocks:<br /> And now at distance can discern <br /> A stirring in a
          brake of fern;<br /> And instantly a dog is seen,<br /> Glancing through
          that covert green. <br /><br /> The Dog is not of mountain breed;<br />
          Its motions, too, are wild and shy; <br /> With something, as the
          Shepherd thinks,<br /> Unusual in its cry:<br /> Nor is there any one in
          sight<br /> All round, in hollow or on height;<br /> Nor shout, nor
          whistle strikes his ear; <br /> What is the creature doing here?<br /><br />
          It was a cove, a huge recess,<br /> That keeps, till June, December's
          snow;<br /> A lofty precipice in front,<br /> A silent tarn below! <br />
          Far in the bosom of Helvellyn,<br /> Remote from public road or
          dwelling,<br /> Pathway, or cultivated land;<br /> From trace of human
          foot or hand.<br /><br /> There sometimes doth a leaping fish <br /> Send
          through the tarn a lonely cheer;<br /> The crags repeat the raven's
          croak, <br /> In symphony austere;<br /> Thither the rainbow comes&mdash;the
          cloud&mdash;<br /> And mists that spread the flying shroud; <br /> And
          sunbeams; and the sounding blast,<br /> That, if it could, would hurry
          past;<br /> But that enormous barrier holds it fast.<br /><br /> Not free
          from boding thoughts, a while<br /> The Shepherd stood; then makes his
          way <br /> O'er rocks and stones, following the Dog <br /> As quickly as
          he may;<br /> Nor far had gone before he found<br /> A human skeleton on
          the ground;<br /> The appalled Discoverer with a sigh <br /> Looks
          round, to learn the history.<br /><br /> From those abrupt and perilous
          rocks<br /> The Man had fallen, that place of fear!<br /> At length upon
          the Shepherd's mind<br /> It breaks, and all is clear: <br /> He
          instantly recalled the name, <br /> And who he was, and whence he came;<br />
          Remembered, too, the very day<br /> On which the Traveller passed this
          way.<br /><br /> But hear a wonder, for whose sake <br /> This lamentable
          tale I tell! <br /> A lasting monument of words<br /> This wonder merits
          well.<br /> The Dog, which still was hovering nigh,<br /> Repeating the
          same timid cry, <br /> This Dog, had been through three months' space<br />
          A dweller in that savage place.<br /><br /> Yes, proof was plain that,
          since the day<br /> When this ill-fated Traveller died, <br /> The Dog
          had watched about the spot, <br /> Or by his master's side:<br /> How
          nourished here through such long time<br /> He knows, who gave that
          love sublime;<br /> And gave that strength of feeling, great<br /> Above
          all human estimate! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="#16n1">Note</a><br />

      Helvellyn, to the east; but Charles Gough was killed on the Kepplecove
      side of Swirell Edge, and not at Red Tarn. Bishop Watson of Llandaff,
      writing to Hayley (see <i>Anecdotes of the Life of Bishop Watson</i>, p.

      some length in his poem, <i>Emont Vale</i>. Wilkinson attended the funeral
      of young Gough, and writes of the incident with feeling, but without
      inspiration. Gough perished early in April, and his body was not found
      till July 22nd, 1805. A reference to his fate will be found in Lockhart's
      <i>Life of Scott</i> (vol. ii. p. 274); also in a letter of Mr. Luff of
      Patterdale, to his wife, July 23rd, 1805. Henry Crabb Robinson records
      (see his <i>Diary, Reminiscences</i>, etc., vol. ii. p. 25) a conversation
      with Wordsworth, in which he said of this poem, that "he purposely made
      the narrative as prosaic as possible, in order that no discredit might be
      thrown on the truth of the incident."&mdash;Ed.</span><br /> <br /> <br />

          On his morning rounds the Master<br /> Goes to learn how all things
          fare;<br /> Searches pasture after pasture,<br /> Sheep and cattle eyes
          with care;<br /> And, for silence or for talk, <br /> He hath comrades
          in his walk;<br /> Four dogs, each pair of different breed,<br />
          Distinguished two for scent, and two for speed.<br /><br /> See a hare
          before him started!<br /> &mdash;Off they fly in earnest chase; <br />
          Every dog is eager-hearted,<br /> All the four are in the race:<br />
          And the hare whom they pursue,<br /> Knows from instinct what to do;<br />
          Her hope is near: no turn she makes; <br /> But, like an arrow, to the
          river takes.<br /><br /> Deep the river was, and crusted<br /> Thinly by
          a one night's frost;<br /> But the nimble Hare hath trusted<br /> To the
          ice, and safely crost; so <br /> She hath crost, and without heed<br />
          All are following at full speed,<br /> When, lo! the ice, so thinly
          spread,<br /> Breaks&mdash;and the greyhound, <b>Dart</b>, is

          to save.<br /><br /> From the brink her paws she stretches,<br /> Very
          hands as you would say!<br /> And afflicting moans she fetches, <br />
          As he breaks the ice away.<br /> For herself she hath no fears,&mdash;<br />
          Him alone she sees and hears,&mdash;<br /> Makes efforts with

          is all we can.<br /> Yet they to whom thy virtues made thee dear<br />
          Shall find thee through all changes of the year:<br /> This Oak points
          out thy grave; the silent tree<br /> Will gladly stand a monument of
          thee. <br /><br /> We grieved for thee, and wished thy end were past;<br />
          And willingly have laid thee here at last:<br /> For thou hadst lived
          till every thing that cheers<br /> In thee had yielded to the weight of
          years;<br /> Extreme old age had wasted thee away, <br /> And left thee
          but a glimmering of the day;<br /> Thy ears were deaf, and feeble were
          thy knees,&mdash;<br /> I saw thee stagger in the summer breeze,<br />
          Too weak to stand against its sportive breath,<br /> And ready for the
          gentlest stroke of death. <br /> It came, and we were glad; yet tears
          were shed;<br /> Both man and woman wept when thou wert dead;<br /> Not
          only for a thousand thoughts that were,<br /> Old household thoughts,
          in which thou hadst thy share;<br /> But for some precious boons
          vouchsafed to thee, <br /> Found scarcely any where in like degree!<br />
          For love, that comes wherever life and sense<br /> Are given by God, in
          thee was most intense;<br /> A chain of heart, a feeling of the mind,<br />
          A tender sympathy, which did thee bind <br /> Not only to us Men, but
          to thy Kind:<br /> Yea, for thy fellow-brutes in thee we saw<br /> A
          soul of love, love's intellectual law:&mdash;<br /> Hence, if we wept,
          it was not done in shame;<br /> Our tears from passion and from reason
          came, <br /> And, therefore, shalt thou be an honoured name!<br /> <br />

          Sweet Flower! belike one day to have<br /> A place upon thy Poet's
          grave,<br /> I welcome thee once more:<br /> But He, who was on land, at
          sea,<br /> My Brother, too, in loving thee, <br /> Although he loved
          more silently,<br /> Sleeps by his native shore.<br /><br /> Ah! hopeful,
          hopeful was the day<br /> When to that Ship he bent his way,<br /> To
          govern and to guide: <br /> His wish was gained: a little time<br />
          Would bring him back in manhood's prime<br /> And free for life, these
          hills to climb;<br /> With all his wants supplied.<br /><br /> And full
          of hope day followed day <br /> While that stout Ship at anchor lay<br />
          Beside the shores of Wight;<br /> The May had then made all things
          green;<br /> And, floating there, in pomp serene,<br /> That Ship was
          goodly to be seen, <br /> His pride and his delight!<br /><br /> Yet
          then, when called ashore, he sought<br /> The tender peace of rural
          thought:<br /> In more than happy mood<br /> To your abodes, bright
          daisy Flowers! <br /> He then would steal at leisure hours,<br /> And
          loved you glittering in your bowers,<br /> A starry multitude.<br /><br />
          But hark the word!&mdash;the ship is gone;&mdash;<br /> Returns from
          her long course:&mdash;anon <br /> Sets sail:&mdash;in season due,<br />
          Once more on English earth they stand:<br /> But, when a third time
          from the land<br /> They parted, sorrow was at hand<br /> For Him and
          for his crew. <br /><br /> Ill-fated Vessel!&mdash;ghastly shock!<br />
          &mdash;At length delivered from the rock,<br /> The deep she hath
          regained;<br /> And through the stormy night they steer;<br /> Labouring
          for life, in hope and fear, <br /> To reach a safer shore&mdash;how
          near,<br /> Yet not to be attained!<br /><br /> "Silence!" the brave
          Commander cried;<br /> To that calm word a shriek replied,<br /> It was
          the last death-shriek. <br /> &mdash;A few (my soul oft sees that
          sight)<br /> Survive upon the tall mast's height;<br /> But one dear
          remnant of the night&mdash;<br /> For Him in vain I seek.<br /><br /> Six
          weeks beneath the moving sea <br /> He lay in slumber quietly;<br />
          Unforced by wind or wave<br /> To quit the Ship for which he died,<br />
          (All claims of duty satisfied;)<br /> And there they found him at her
          side; <br /> And bore him to the grave.<br /><br /> Vain service! yet not
          vainly done<br /> For this, if other end were none,<br /> That He, who
          had been cast<br /> Upon a way of life unmeet <br /> For such a gentle
          Soul and sweet,<br /> Should find an undisturbed retreat<br /> Near what
          he loved, at last&mdash;<br /><br /> That neighbourhood of grove and
          field<br /> To Him a resting-place should yield, <br /> A meek man and a
          brave!<br /> The birds shall sing and ocean make<br /> A mournful murmur
          for <i>his</i> sake;<br /> And Thou, sweet Flower, shalt sleep and wake<br />
          Upon his senseless grave.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="#Btoc">Contents

          I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged Pile!<br /> Four summer weeks I
          dwelt in sight of thee:<br /> I saw thee every day; and all the while<br />
          Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea.<br /><br /> So pure the sky, so
          quiet was the air! <br /> So like, so very like, was day to day!<br />
          Whene'er I looked, thy Image still was there;<br /> It trembled, but it
          never passed away.<br /><br /> How perfect was the calm! it seemed no
          sleep;<br /> No mood, which season takes away, or brings: <br /> I could
          have fancied that the mighty Deep<br /> Was even the gentlest of all
          gentle Things.<br /><br /> Ah! <b>Then</b>, if mine had been the
          Painter's hand,<br /> To express what then I saw; and add the gleam,<br />
          The light that never was, on sea or land, <br /> The consecration, and
          the Poet's dream;<br /><br /> I would have planted thee, thou hoary Pile<br />
          Amid a world how different from this!<br /> Beside a sea that could not
          cease to smile;<br /> On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss. <br /><br />
          Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine<br /> Of peaceful
          years; a chronicle of heaven;&mdash;<br /> Of all the sunbeams that did
          ever shine<br /> The very sweetest had to thee been given.<br /><br /> A
          Picture had it been of lasting ease, <br /> Elysian quiet, without toil
          or strife;<br /> No motion but the moving tide, a breeze,<br /> Or
          merely silent Nature's breathing life.<br /><br /> Such, in the fond
          illusion of my heart,<br /> Such Picture would I at that time have
          made: <br /> And seen the soul of truth in every part,<br /> A stedfast
          peace that might not be betrayed.<br /><br /> So once it would have
          been,&mdash;'tis so no more;<br /> I have submitted to a new control:<br />
          A power is gone, which nothing can restore; <br /> A deep distress hath
          humanised my Soul.<br /><br /> Not for a moment could I now behold<br />
          A smiling sea, and be what I have been:<br /> The feeling of my loss
          will ne'er be old;<br /> This, which I know, I speak with mind serene.
          <br /><br /> Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the Friend,<br />
          If he had lived, of Him whom I deplore,<br /> This work of thine I
          blame not, but commend;<br /> This sea in anger, and that dismal shore.<br /><br />
          O 'tis a passionate Work!&mdash;yet wise and well, <br /> Well chosen
          is the spirit that is here;<br /> That Hulk which labours in the deadly
          swell,<br /> This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!<br /><br /> And
          this huge Castle, standing here sublime,<br /> love to see the look
          with which it braves, <br /> Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time,<br />
          The lightning, the fierce wind, and trampling waves.<br /><br />
          Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone,<br /> Housed in a dream,
          at distance from the Kind!<br /> Such happiness, wherever it be known,
          <br /> Is to be pitied; for 'tis surely blind.<br /><br /> But welcome
          fortitude, and patient cheer,<br /> And frequent sights of what is to
          be borne!<br /> Such sights, or worse, as are before me here.&mdash;<br />
          Not without hope we suffer and we mourn. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a

    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">The Principal had not remembered at the time
      that the "perfection of ideality" was in the original edition of 1807. The
      curious thing is that the prosaic version of 1820 and 1827 ever took its
      place. Wordsworth's return to his original reading was one of the wisest
      changes he introduced into the text of 1832.&mdash;Ed.</span><br /> <a

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <a name="20n1"></a><i><b>Note:</b></i> &nbsp; <span
      style="color: #555555;">There is a Peele Castle, on a small rocky island,
      close to the town of Peele, in the Isle of Man; yet separated from it,
      much as St. Michael's Mount in Cornwall is separated from the mainland.
      This castle was believed by many to be the one which Sir George painted,
      and which gave rise to the foregoing lines. I visited it in 1879, being
      then ignorant that any other Peele Castle existed; and although, the day
      being calm, and the season summer, I thought Sir George had idealized his
      subject much&mdash;(as I had just left Coleorton, where the picture still
      exists)&mdash;I accepted the customary opinion. <a name="fr20B" id="fr20B">But</a>
      I am now convinced, both from the testimony of the Arnold family<a
      href="#20B"><sup>B</sup></a>, and as the result of a visit to Piel Castle,
      near Barrow in Furness, that Wordsworth refers to it. The late Bishop of
      Lincoln, in his uncle's <i>Memoirs</i> (vol. i. p. 299), quotes the line</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged pile,"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">and adds, </span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "He had spent four weeks there of a college summer vacation at the house
        of his cousin, Mr. Barker."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">This house was at Rampside, the village
      opposite Piel, on the coast of Lancashire. The "rugged pile," too, now
      "cased in the unfeeling armour of old time," painted by Beaumont, is
      obviously this Piel Castle near Barrow. I took the engraving of his
      picture with me, when visiting it: and although Sir George&mdash;after the
      manner of landscape artists of his day&mdash;took many liberties with his
      subjects, it is apparent that it was this, and not Peele Castle in Mona,
      that he painted. The "four summer weeks" referred to in the first stanza,
      were those spent at Piel during the year 1794.<br /> <br /> With the last
      verse of these <i>Elegiac Stanzas</i> compare stanzas ten and eleven of
      the <i>Ode, Intimations of Immortality</i>, vol. viii.<br /> <br /> One of
      the two pictures of "Peele Castle in a Storm"&mdash;engraved by S. W.
      Reynolds, and published in the editions of Wordsworth's poems of 1815 and
      1820&mdash;is still in the Beaumont Gallery at Coleorton Hall.<br /> <br />
      The poem is so memorable that I have arranged to make this picture of
      "Peele Castle in a Storm," the vignette to vol. xv. of this edition. It
      deserves to be noted that it was to the pleading of Barron Field that we
      owe the restoration of the original line of 1807,</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'The light that never was, on sea or land.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">An interesting account of Piel Castle will
      be found in Hearne and Byrne's <i>Antiquities.</i> It was built by the
      Abbot of Furness in the first year of the reign of Edward III.&mdash;Ed.</span><br />

        "Moss Campion (<i>Silene acaulis</i>). This most beautiful plant is
        scarce in England, though it is found in great abundance upon the
        mountains of Scotland. The first specimen I ever saw of it in its native
        bed was singularly fine, the tuft or cushion being at least eight inches
        diameter, and the root proportionably thick. I have only met with it in
        two places among our mountains, in both of which I have since sought for
        it in vain.<br /> <br /> Botanists will not, I hope, take it ill, if I
        caution them against carrying off inconsiderately rare and beautiful
        plants. This has often been done, particularly from Ingleborough and
        other mountains in Yorkshire, till the species have totally disappeared,
        to the great regret of lovers of nature living near the places where
        they grew."&mdash;W. W. 1842.

      style="color: #555555;">This poem underwent no change in successive
      editions.<br /> <br /> At a meeting of "The Wordsworth Society" held at
      Grasmere, in July 1881, it was proposed by one of the members, the Rev. H.
      D. Rawnsley, then Vicar of Wray, to erect some memorial at the
      parting-place of the brothers. The brothers John and William Wordsworth
      parted at Grisedale Tarn, on the 29th September 1800. The originator of
      the idea wrote thus of it in June 1882:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "A proposition, made by one of its members to the Wordsworth Society
        when it met in Grasmere in 1881, to mark the spot in the Grisedale Pass
        of Wordsworth's parting from his brother John&mdash;and to carry out a
        wish the poet seems to have hinted at in the last of his elegiac verses
        in memory of that parting&mdash;is now being put into effect. It has
        been determined, after correspondence with Lord Coleridge, Dr. Cradock,
        Professor Knight, and Mr. Hills, to have inscribed &mdash;(on the native
        rock, if possible)&mdash;the first four lines of Stanzas III. and VII.
        of these verses:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'Here did we stop; and here looked round<br /> While each into himself
          descends,<br /> For that last thought of parting Friends<br /> That is
          not to be found.<br /> ...<br /> Brother and friend, if verse of mine<br />
          Have power to make thy virtues known,<br /> Here let a monumental Stone<br />
          Stand&mdash;sacred as a Shrine.'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The rock selected is a fine mass, facing the east, on the left of the
        track as one descends from Grisedale Tarn towards Patterdale, and is
        about 100 yards from the tarn. No more suitable one can be found, and we
        have the testimony of Mr. David Richardson of Newcastle, who has
        practical knowledge of engineering, that it is the fittest, both from
        shape and from slight incline of plane.<br /> <br /> It has been proposed
        to sink a panel in the face of the rock, that so the inscription may be
        slightly protected, and to engrave the letters upon the face of the
        panel thus obtained. But it is not quite certain yet that the grain of
        the rock&mdash; volcanic ash&mdash;will admit of the lettering. If this
        cannot be carried out, it has been determined to have the letters
        engraved upon a slab of Langdale slate, and imbed it in the Grisedale
        Rock.<br /> <br /> It is believed that the simplicity of the design, the
        lonely isolation of this mountain memorial, will appeal at once
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          ' ... to the few who pass this way,<br /> Traveller or Shepherd.'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        And we in our turn appeal to English tourists who may chance to see it,
        to forego the wish of adding to it, or taking anything from it, by
        engraving their own names; and to let the Monumental Stone stand, as the
        poet wished it might
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          ' ... stand, <b>sacred</b> as a Shrine.'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        We owe great thanks to Mrs. Sturge for first surveying the place, to
        ascertain the possibility of finding a mountain rock sufficiently
        striking in position; to Mr. Richardson, jun., for his etching of the
        rock, upon which the inscription is to be made; to his father for the
        kind trouble he took in the measurement of the said rock; and
        particularly to the seconder of the original proposal, and my coadjutor
        in the task of final selection and superintending the work, Mr. W. H.
        Hills. <b>H. D. Rawnsley</b>. <i>P. S.</i>&mdash;When we came to examine
        the rock, we found the area for the panel less than we had hoped for,
        owing to certain rock fissures, which, by acting as drains for the
        rainwater on the surface, would have much interfered with the durability
        of the inscription. The available space for the panel remains 3 feet 7
        in length by 1 foot 9 inches in depth. Owing to the fineness of the
        grain of the stone, it may be quite possible to letter the native rock;
        but it has been difficult to fix on a style of lettering for the
        inscription that shall be at once in good taste, forcible, and plain. It
        was proposed that the Script type of letter which was made use of in the
        inscription cut on the rock, in the late Mr. Ball's garden grounds below
        the Mount at Rydal, should be adopted; but a final decision has been
        given in favour of a style of lettering which Mrs. Rawnsley has
        designed. The panel is, from its position, certain to attract the eye of
        the wanderer from Patterdale up to the Grisedale Pass.<br /> <br /> H. D.

        again above water when the 'Abergavenny' touched the ground. The ship

      of Dorothy Wordsworth's, written to her friend Miss Jane Pollard
      (afterwards Mrs. Marshall), in reference to her brother's death, which may
      find a place here. For the use of it I am indebted to the kindness of Mrs.
      Marshall's daughter, the Dowager Lady Monteagle:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "March 16th, 1805. Grasmere.<br /> <br /> "... It does me good to weep for
        him, and it does me good to find that others weep, and I bless them for
        it. ... It is with me, when I write, as when I am walking out in this
        vale, once so full of joy. I can turn to no object that does not remind
        me of our loss. I see nothing that he would not have loved, and
        enjoyed.... My consolations rather come to me in gusts of feeling, than
        are the quiet growth of my mind. I know it will not always be so. The
        time will come when the light of the setting sun upon these mountain
        tops will be as heretofore a pure joy; not the same <i>gladness</i>,
        that can never be&mdash;but yet a joy even more tender. It will soothe
        me to know how happy he would have been, could he have seen the same
        beautiful spectacle.... He was taken away in the freshness of his
        manhood; pure he was, and innocent as a child. Never human being was
        more thoroughly modest, and his courage I need not speak of. He was
        'seen speaking with apparent cheerfulness to the first mate a few
        minutes before the ship went down;' and when nothing more could be done,
        He said, 'the will of God be done.' I have no doubt when he felt that it
        was out of his power to save his life he was as calm as before, if some
        thought of what we should endure did not awaken a pang.... He loved
        solitude, and he rejoiced in society. He would wander alone amongst
        these hills with his fishing-rod, or led on by the mere pleasure of
        walking, for many hours; or he would walk with W. or me, or both of us,
        and was continually pointing out&mdash;with a gladness which is seldom
        seen but in very young people&mdash;something which perhaps would have
        escaped our observation; for he had so fine an eye that no distinction
        was unnoticed by him, and so tender a feeling that he never noticed
        anything in vain. Many a time has he called out to me at evening to look
        at the moon or stars, or a cloudy sky, or this vale in the quiet
        moonlight; but the stars and moon were his chief delight. He made of
        them his companions when he was at sea, and was never tired of those
        thoughts which the silence of the night fed in him. Then he was so happy
        by the fireside. Any little business of the house interested him. He
        loved our cottage. He helped us to furnish it, and to make the garden.
        Trees are growing now which he planted.... He staid with us till the
        29th of September, having come to us about the end of January. During
        that time Mary Hutchinson&mdash;now Mary Wordsworth&mdash;staid with us
        six weeks. John used to walk with her everywhere, and they were
        exceedingly attached to each other; so my poor sister mourns with us,
        not merely because we have lost one who was so dear to William and me,
        but from tender love to John and an intimate knowledge of him. Her hopes
        as well as ours were fixed on John.... I can think of nothing but of our
        departed Brother, yet I am very tranquil to-day. I honour him, and love
        him, and glory in his memory...."

      <span style="color: #555555;">Southey, writing to his friend, C. W. W.
      Wynn, on the 3rd of April 1805, says:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "<b>Dear Wynn</b>,<br /> <br /> I have been grievously shocked this
        evening by the loss of the <i>Abergavenny</i>, of which Wordsworth's
        brother was captain. Of course the news came flying up to us from all
        quarters, and it has disordered me from head to foot. At such
        circumstances I believe we feel as much for others as for ourselves;
        just as a violent blow occasions the same pain as a wound, and he who
        breaks his shin feels as acutely at the moment as the man whose leg is
        shot off. In fact, I am writing to you merely because this dreadful
        shipwreck has left me utterly unable to do anything else. It is the
        heaviest calamity Wordsworth has ever experienced, and in all
        probability I shall have to communicate it to him, as he will very
        likely be here before the tidings can reach him. What renders any near
        loss of this kind so peculiarly distressing is, that the recollection is
        perpetually freshened when any like event occurs, by the mere mention of
        shipwreck, or the sound of the wind. Of all deaths it is the most
        dreadful, from the circumstances of terror which accompany it...."

        wakeful sense of happiness. That you would see every object with and

          When, to the attractions of the busy world,<br /> Preferring studious
          leisure, I had chosen<br /> A habitation in this peaceful Vale,<br />
          Sharp season followed of continual storm<br /> In deepest winter; and,
          from week to week, <br /> Pathway, and lane, and public road, were
          clogged<br /> With frequent showers of snow. Upon a hill<br /> At a
          short distance from my cottage, stands<br /> A stately Fir-grove,
          whither I was wont<br /> To hasten, for I found, beneath the roof <br />
          Of that perennial shade, a cloistral place<br /> Of refuge, with an
          unincumbered floor.<br /> Here, in safe covert, on the shallow snow,<br />
          And, sometimes, on a speck of visible earth,<br /> The redbreast near
          me hopped; nor was I loth<br /> To sympathise with vulgar coppice birds<br />
          That, for protection from the nipping blast,<br /> Hither repaired.&mdash;A
          single beech-tree grew<br /> Within this grove of firs! and, on the
          fork<br /> Of that one beech, appeared a thrush's nest;<br /> A last
          year's nest, conspicuously built<br /> At such small elevation from the
          ground<br /> As gave sure sign that they, who in that house<br /> Of
          nature and of love had made their home<br /> Amid the fir-trees, all
          the summer long <br /> Dwelt in a tranquil spot. And oftentimes,<br /> A
          few sheep, stragglers from some mountain-flock,<br /> Would watch my
          motions with suspicious stare,<br /> From the remotest outskirts of the
          grove,&mdash;<br /> Some nook where they had made their final stand,<br />
          Huddling together from two fears&mdash;the fear <br /> Of me and of the
          storm. Full many an hour<br /> Here did I lose. But in this grove the
          trees<br /> Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven<br /> In such
          perplexed and intricate array; <br /> That vainly did I seek, beneath
          their stems<br /> A length of open space, where to and fro<br /> My feet
          might move without concern or care;<br /> And, baffled thus, though
          earth from day to day<br /> Was fettered, and the air by storm
          disturbed, <br /> I ceased the shelter to frequent,&mdash;and prized,<br />
          Less than I wished to prize, that calm recess.<br /><br /> The snows
          dissolved, and genial Spring returned<br /> To clothe the fields with
          verdure. Other haunts<br /> Meanwhile were mine; till, one bright April
          day,<br /> By chance retiring from the glare of noon <br /> To this
          forsaken covert, there I found<br /> A hoary pathway traced between the
          trees,<br /> And winding on with such an easy line<br /> Along a natural
          opening, that I stood <br /> Much wondering how I could have sought in
          vain<br /> For what was now so obvious. To abide,<br /> For an allotted
          interval of ease,<br /> Under my cottage-roof, had gladly come<br />
          From the wild sea a cherished Visitant; <br /> And with the sight of
          this same path&mdash;begun,<br /> Begun and ended, in the shady grove,<br />
          Pleasant conviction flashed upon my mind<br /> That, to this opportune
          recess allured,<br /> He had surveyed it with a finer eye, <br /> A
          heart more wakeful; and had worn the track<br /> By pacing here,
          unwearied and alone,<br /> In that habitual restlessness of foot<br />
          That haunts the Sailor measuring o'er and o'er<br /> His short domain
          upon the vessel's deck, <br /> While she pursues her course through the
          dreary sea.<br /> When thou hadst quitted Esthwaite's pleasant shore,<br />
          And taken thy first leave of those green hills<br /> And rocks that
          were the play-ground of thy youth,<br /> Year followed year, my
          Brother! and we two, <br /> Conversing not, knew little in what mould<br />
          Each other's mind was fashioned; and at length<br /> When once again we
          met in Grasmere Vale,<br /> Between us there was little other bond<br />
          Than common feelings of fraternal love. <br /> But thou, a School-boy,
          to the sea hadst carried<br /> Undying recollections; Nature there<br />
          Was with thee; she, who loved us both, she still<br /> Was with thee;
          and even so didst thou become<br /> A <i>silent</i> Poet; from the
          solitude <br /> Of the vast sea didst bring a watchful heart<br /> Still
          couchant, an inevitable ear,<br /> And an eye practised like a blind
          man's touch.<br /> &mdash;Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone;<br />
          Nor from this vestige of thy musing hours <br /> Could I withhold thy
          honoured name,&mdash;and now<br /> I love the fir-grove with a perfect
          love.<br /> Thither do I withdraw when cloudless suns<br /> Shine hot,
          or wind blows troublesome and strong;<br /> And there I sit at evening,
          when the steep <br /> Of Silver-how, and Grasmere's peaceful lake,<br />
          And one green island, gleam between the stems<br /> Of the dark firs, a
          visionary scene!<br /> And, while I gaze upon the spectacle<br /> Of
          clouded splendour, on this dream-like sight <br /> Of solemn
          loveliness, I think on thee,<br /> My Brother, and on all which thou
          hast lost.<br /> Nor seldom, if I rightly guess, while Thou,<br />
          Muttering the verses which I muttered first<br /> Among the mountains,
          through the midnight watch<br /> Art pacing thoughtfully the vessel's
          deck <br /> In some far region, here, while o'er my head,<br /> At every
          impulse of the moving breeze,<br /> The fir-grove murmurs with a
          sea-like sound,<br /> Alone I tread this path;&mdash;for aught I know,
          <br /> Timing my steps to thine; and, with a store<br /> Of
          undistinguishable sympathies,<br /> Mingling most earnest wishes for
          the day<br /> When we, and others whom we love, shall meet<br /> A
          second time, in Grasmere's happy Vale. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a

      not granted; the lamented Person, not long after, perished by shipwreck,
      in discharge of his duty as Commander of the Honourable East India
      Company's Vessel, the <i>Earl of Abergavenny</i>.&mdash;W. W. 1815.<br />
      <br /> <span style="color: #555555;">For the date of this poem in the
      Chronological Tables given in the editions of 1815 and 1820, Wordsworth
      assigned the year 1802. But, in the edition of 1836, he assigned it to the
      year 1805, the date retained by Mr. Carter in the edition of 1857. Captain
      Wordsworth perished on the 5th of February 1805; and if the poem was
      written in 1805, it must have been in the month of January of that year.
      The note to the poem is explicit&mdash;"Not long after" he "perished by
      shipwreck," etc. Thus the poem <i>may</i> have been written in the
      beginning of 1805; but it is not at all certain that part of it at least
      does not belong to an earlier year. John Wordsworth lived with his brother
      and sister at the Town-end Cottage, Grasmere, during part of the winter,
      and during the whole of the spring, summer, and autumn of 1800, William
      and John going together on foot into Yorkshire from the 14th of May to the
      7th of June. John left Grasmere on Michaelmas day (September 29th) 1800,
      and never returned to it again. The following is Miss Wordsworth's record
      of that day in her <i>Journal</i> of 1800:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "On Monday, 29th, John left us. William and I parted with him in sight
        of Ullswater. It was a fine day, showery, but with sunshine and fine
        clouds. Poor fellow, my heart was right sad, I could not help thinking
        we should see him again, because he was only going to Penrith."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">In the spring of 1801, John Wordsworth
      sailed for China in the <i>Abergavenny.</i> He returned from this voyage
      in safety, and the brothers met once again in London. He went to sea again
      in 1803, and returned to London in 1804, but could not visit Grasmere; and
      in the month of February 1805&mdash;shortly after he was appointed to the
      command of the <i>Abergavenny&mdash;</i> the ship was lost at the Bill of
      Portland, and every one on board perished. It is clear that the latter
      part of the poem, "When, to the attractions of the busy world," was
      written between John Wordsworth's departure from Grasmere and the loss of
      the <i>Abergavenny, i. e.</i> between September 1800 and February 1805, as
      there are references in it both to what his brother did at Grasmere and to
      his return to sea: </span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">There are some things in the earlier part of
      the poem that appear to negative the idea of its having been written in
      1800. The opening lines seem to hint at an experience somewhat distant. He
      speaks of being "wont" to do certain things. But, on the other hand, I
      find an entry in Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i>, which leads me to
      believe that the poem may have been begun in 1800, and that the first
      part, ending (as it did then) with the line:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'While she is travelling through the dreary sea,'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">may have been finished before John
      Wordsworth left Grasmere; the second part being written afterwards, while
      he was at sea; and that this is the explanation of the date given in the
      editions of 1815 and 1820, viz. 1802.<br /> <br /> Passages occur in Dorothy
      Wordsworth's <i>Journal</i> to the following effect:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Monday Morning, 1st September.&mdash;We walked in the wood by the lake.
        William read <i>Joanna</i> and <i>the Firgrove</i> to Coleridge."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">A little earlier there is the record,</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Saturday, 22nd August.&mdash;William was composing all the morning....
        William read us the poem of <i>Joanna</i> beside the Rothay by the
        roadside."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">Then, on Friday, the 25th August, there is
      the entry, </span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "We walked over the hill by the Firgrove, I sate upon a rock and
        observed a flight of swallows gathering together high above my head. We
        walked through the wood to the stepping stones, the lake of Rydale very
        beautiful, partly still, I left William to compose an inscription, that
        about the path...."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">Then, next day, </span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Saturday morning, 30th August.&mdash;William finished his inscription
        of the Pathway, then walked in the wood, and when John returned he
        sought him, and they bathed together."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">To what poem Dorothy Wordsworth referred
      under the name of the "Inscription of the Pathway" has puzzled me much.
      There is no poem amongst his "Inscriptions" (written in or before August
      1800) that corresponds to it in the least. But, if my conjecture is right
      that this "Poem on the Naming of Places," beginning:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'When, to the attractions of the busy world,'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">was composed at two different times, it is
      quite possible that "the Firgrove" which was read&mdash;along with <i>Joanna</i>&mdash;to
      Coleridge on September lst, 1800, was the first part of this very poem.<br />
      <br /> If this supposition is correct, some light is cast both on the
      "Inscription of the Pathway." and on the date assigned by Wordsworth
      himself to the poem. There is a certain fitness, however, in this poem
      being placed&mdash;as it now is&mdash;in sequence to the <a
      href="#section21"><i>Elegiac Verses</i></a> in memory of John Wordsworth,
      beginning, "The Sheep-boy whistled loud," and near the fourth poem <a
      href="#section19"><i>To the Daisy</i></a>, beginning, "Sweet Flower!
      belike one day to have."<br /> <br /> The "Fir-grove" still exists. It is
      between Wishing Gate and White Moss Common, and almost exactly opposite
      the former. Standing at the gate and looking eastwards, the grove is to
      the left, not forty yards distant. Some of the firs (Scotch ones) still
      survive, and several beech trees, not "a single beech-tree," as in the
      poem. From this, one might infer that the present colony had sprung up
      since the beginning of the century, and that the special tree, in which
      was the thrush's nest, had perished; but Dr. Cradock wrote to me that
      "Wordsworth pointed out the tree to Miss Cookson a few days before Dora
      Wordsworth's death. The tree is near the upper wall and tells its own
      tale." The Fir-grove&mdash;"John's Grove"&mdash; can easily be entered by
      a gate about a hundred yards beyond the Wishing-gate, as one goes toward
      Rydal. The view from it, the "visionary scene,"</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'the spectacle<br />
        Of clouded splendour, ... this dream-like sight<br /> Of solemn
        loveliness,'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">is now much interfered with by the new larch
      plantations immediately below the firs. It must have been very different
      in Wordsworth's time, and is constantly referred to in his sister's <i>Journal</i>
      as a favourite retreat, resorted to</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'when cloudless suns<br /> 'Shone hot, or wind blew troublesome and
        strong.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">In the absence of contrary testimony, it
      might be supposed that "the track" which the brother had "worn,"</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'By pacing here, unwearied and alone,'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">faced Silver-How and the Grasmere Island,
      and that the single beech tree was nearer the lower than the upper wall.
      But Miss Cookson's testimony is explicit. Only a few fir trees survive at
      this part of the grove, which is now open and desolate, not as it was in
      those earlier days, when</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'the trees<br />
        Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven<br /> With such perplexed
        and intricate array,<br /> That vainly did I seek, beneath their stems<br />
        A length of open space ...'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">Dr. Cradock remarks, </span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "As to there being more than one beech, Wordsworth would not have
        hesitated to sacrifice servile exactness to poetical effect." He had a
        fancy for "one":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'Fair as a star when only one<br /> Is shining in the sky;'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        "'One' abode, no more;" Grasmere's "one green island;" "one green
        field."
      </p>
    </blockquote>

      <br /> <br /> <a name="22n1"></a><i><b>Note:</b></i> &nbsp;<span
      style="color: #555555;">This poem underwent no change in successive
      editions. The title in all the earlier ones (1815 to 1843) was <i>The
      Cottager to her Infant. By a Female Friend</i>; and in the preface to the
      edition of 1815, Wordsworth wrote,</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Three short pieces (now first published) are the work of a Female
        Friend; ... if any one regard them with dislike, or be disposed to
        condemn them, let the censure fall upon him, who, trusting in his own
        sense of their merit, and their fitness for the place which they occupy,
        <i>extorted</i> them from the Authoress."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the edition of 1845, he disclosed the authorship; and gave the more
      natural title, <i>By my Sister</i>. Other two poems by her were introduced
      into the edition of 1815, and subsequent ones, viz. the <i>Address to a
      Child</i>, and <i>The Mother's Return</i>. In an appendix to a MS. copy of
      the <i>Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland</i>, by Dorothy
      Wordsworth, transcribed by Mrs. Clarkson, I find the poem 'The Cottager to
      her Infant' with two additional stanzas, which are there attributed to
      Wordsworth. The appendix runs thus:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "To my Niece Dorothy, a sleepless Baby<br /> <br /> <b>The Cottager to Her
        Infant</b><br /> <br /> (The third and fourth stanzas which follow by W.
        W.)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'Ah! if I were a lady gay<br /> I should not grieve with thee to play;<br />
          Right gladly would I lie awake<br /> Thy lively spirits to partake,<br />
          And ask no better cheer.<br /> <br /> But, Babe! there's none to work
          for me.<br /> And I must rise to industry;<br /> Soon as the cock begins
          to crow<br /> Thy mother to the fold must go<br /> To tend the sheep and
          kine.'"
        </p>

      <br /> <br /> <b>To Charles Lamb, Esq.<br /> <br /> My Dear Friend,</b><br />
      <br /> When I sent you, a few weeks ago, the Tale of <i>Peter Bell</i>, you
      asked "why <b>The Waggoner</b> was not added?"&mdash;To say the truth,&mdash;from
      the higher tone of imagination, and the deeper touches of passion aimed at
      in the former, I apprehended, this little Piece could not accompany it
      without disadvantage. In the year 1806, if I am not mistaken, <b>The
      Waggoner</b> was read to you in manuscript; and, as you have remembered it
      for so long a time, I am the more encouraged to hope, that, since the
      localities on which it partly depends did not prevent its being
      interesting to you, it may prove acceptable to others. Being therefore in
      some measure the cause of its present appearance, you must allow me the
      gratification of inscribing it to you; in acknowledgment of the pleasure I
      have derived from your Writings, and of the high esteem with which I am
      Very truly yours, <b>William Wordsworth.<br /> <br /> Rydal Mount</b>, <i>May
      20th</i>, 1819.<br /> <br /> <br />

          'Tis spent&mdash;this burning day of June!<br /> Soft darkness o'er its
          latest gleams is stealing;<br /> The buzzing dor-hawk, round and round,
          is wheeling,&mdash;<br /> That solitary bird<br /> Is all that can be
          heard <br /> In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon!<br /><br />
          Confiding Glow-worms, 'tis a night<br /> Propitious to your earth-born
          light!<br /> But, where the scattered stars are seen<br /> In hazy
          straits the clouds between, <br /> Each, in his station twinkling not,<br />
          Seems changed into a pallid spot.<br /> The mountains against heaven's
          grave weight<br /> Rise up, and grow to wondrous height.<br /> The air,
          as in a lion's den, <br /> Is close and hot;&mdash;and now and then<br />
          Comes a tired and sultry breeze<br /> With a haunting and a panting,<br />
          Like the stifling of disease;<br /> But the dews allay the heat, <br />
          And the silence makes it sweet.<br /><br /> Hush, there is some one on
          the stir!<br /> 'Tis Benjamin the Waggoner;<br /> Who long hath trod
          this toilsome way,<br /> Companion of the night and day. <br /> That
          far-off tinkling's drowsy cheer,<br /> Mix'd with a faint yet grating
          sound<br /> In a moment lost and found,<br /> The Wain announces&mdash;by
          whose side<br /> Along the banks of Rydal Mere <br /> He paces on, a
          trusty Guide,&mdash;<br /> Listen! you can scarcely hear!<br /> Hither
          he his course is bending;&mdash;<br /> Now he leaves the lower ground,<br />
          And up the craggy hill ascending <br /> Many a stop and stay he makes,<br />
          Many a breathing-fit he takes;&mdash;<br /> Steep the way and
          wearisome,<br /> Yet all the while his whip is dumb! <br /><br /> The
          Horses have worked with right good-will,<br /> And so have gained the
          top of the hill;<br /> He was patient, they were strong,<br /> And now
          they smoothly glide along,<br /> Recovering breath, and pleased to win<br />
          The praises of mild Benjamin. <br /> Heaven shield him from mishap and
          snare!<br /> But why so early with this prayer?<br /> Is it for
          threatenings in the sky?<br /> Or for some other danger nigh?<br /> No;
          none is near him yet, though he <br /> Be one of much infirmity;<br />
          For at the bottom of the brow,<br /> Where once the <b>Dove</b> and <b>Olive-bough</b><br />
          Offered a greeting of good ale<br /> To all who entered Grasmere Vale;
          <br /> And called on him who must depart<br /> To leave it with a jovial
          heart;<br /> There, where the <b>Dove</b> and <b>Olive-bough</b><br />
          Once hung, a Poet harbours now,<br /> A simple water-drinking Bard;
          <br /> Why need our Hero then (though frail<br /> His best resolves) be
          on his guard?<br /> He marches by, secure and bold;<br /> Yet while he
          thinks on times of old,<br /> It seems that all looks wondrous cold;
          <br /> He shrugs his shoulders, shakes his head,<br /> And, for the
          honest folk within,<br /> It is a doubt with Benjamin<br /> Whether they
          be alive or dead!<br /><br /> <i>Here</i> is no danger,&mdash;none at
          all! <br /> Beyond his wish he walks secure;<br /> But pass a mile&mdash;and
          <i>then</i> for trial,&mdash;<br /> Then for the pride of self-denial;<br />
          If he resist that tempting door,<br /> Which with such friendly voice
          will call; <br /> If he resist those casement panes,<br /> And that
          bright gleam which thence will fall<br /> Upon his Leaders' bells and
          manes,<br /> Inviting him with cheerful lure:<br /> For still, though
          all be dark elsewhere, <br /> Some shining notice will be <i>there</i><br />
          Of open house and ready fare.<br /><br /> The place to Benjamin right
          well<br /> Is known, and by as strong a spell<br /> As used to be that
          sign of love <br /> And hope&mdash;the <b>Olive-bough</b> and <b>Dove</b>;<br />
          He knows it to his cost, good Man!<br /> Who does not know the famous
          <b>Swan</b>?<br /> Object uncouth! and yet our boast,<br /> For it was
          painted by the Host; <br /> His own conceit the figure planned,<br />
          'Twas coloured all by his own hand;<br /> And that frail Child of
          thirsty clay,<br /> Of whom I sing this rustic lay,<br /> Could tell
          with self-dissatisfaction <br /> Quaint stories of the bird's
          attraction!<br /><br /> Well! that is past&mdash;and in despite<br /> Of
          open door and shining light.<br /> And now the conqueror essays<br />
          The long ascent of Dunmail-raise; <br /> And with his team is gentle
          here<br /> As when he clomb from Rydal Mere;<br /> His whip they do not
          dread&mdash;his voice<br /> They only hear it to rejoice.<br /> To stand
          or go is at <i>their</i> pleasure; <br /> Their efforts and their time
          they measure<br /> By generous pride within the breast;<br /> And, while
          they strain, and while they rest,<br /> He thus pursues his thoughts at
          leisure.<br /><br /> Now am I fairly safe to-night&mdash; <br /> And with
          proud cause my heart is light:<br /> I trespassed lately worse than
          ever&mdash;<br /> But Heaven has blest a good endeavour;<br /> And, to
          my soul's content, I find<br /> The evil One is left behind. <br /> Yes,
          let my master fume and fret,<br /> Here am I&mdash;with my horses yet!<br />
          My jolly team, he finds that ye<br /> Will work for nobody but me!<br />
          Full proof of this the Country gained; <br /> It knows how ye were
          vexed and strained,<br /> And forced unworthy stripes to bear,<br />
          When trusted to another's care.<br /> Here was it&mdash;on this rugged
          slope,<br /> Which now ye climb with heart and hope, <br /> I saw you,
          between rage and fear,<br /> Plunge, and fling back a spiteful ear,<br />
          And ever more and more confused,<br /> As ye were more and more abused:<br />
          As chance would have it, passing by <br /> I saw you in that jeopardy:<br />
          A word from me was like a charm;<br /> Ye pulled together with one
          mind;<br /> And your huge burthen, safe from harm,<br /> Moved like a
          vessel in the wind! <br /> &mdash;Yes, without me, up hills so high<br />
          'Tis vain to strive for mastery.<br /> Then grieve not, jolly team!
          though tough<br /> The road we travel, steep, and rough;<br /> Though
          Rydal-heights and Dunmail-raise, <br /> And all their fellow banks and
          braes,<br /> Full often make you stretch and strain,<br /> And halt for
          breath and halt again,<br /> Yet to their sturdiness 'tis owing<br />
          That side by side we still are going! <br /><br /> While Benjamin in
          earnest mood<br /> His meditations thus pursued,<br /> A storm, which
          had been smothered long,<br /> Was growing inwardly more strong;<br />
          And, in its struggles to get free, <br /> Was busily employed as he.<br />
          The thunder had begun to growl&mdash;<br /> He heard not, too intent of
          soul;<br /> The air was now without a breath&mdash;<br /> He marked not
          that 'twas still as death. <br /> But soon large rain-drops on his head<br />
          Fell with the weight of drops of lead;&mdash;<br /> He starts&mdash;and
          takes, at the admonition,<br /> A sage survey of his condition.<br />
          The road is black before his eyes,<br /> Glimmering faintly where it
          lies;<br /> Black is the sky&mdash;and every hill,<br /> Up to the sky,
          is blacker still&mdash;<br /> Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room,<br />
          Hung round and overhung with gloom; <br /> Save that above a single
          height<br /> Is to be seen a lurid light,<br /> Above Helm-crag&mdash;a
          streak half dead,<br /> A burning of portentous red;<br /> And near that
          lurid light, full well <br /> The <b>Astrologer</b>, sage Sidrophel,<br />
          Where at his desk and book he sits,<br /> Puzzling aloft his curious
          wits;<br /> He whose domain is held in common<br /> With no one but the
          <b>Ancient Woman</b>, <br /> Cowering beside her rifted cell,<br /> As
          if intent on magic spell;-<br /> Dread pair, that, spite of wind and
          weather,<br /> Still sit upon Helm-crag together!<br /><br /> The <b>Astrologer</b>
          was not unseen <br /> By solitary Benjamin;<br /> But total darkness
          came anon,<br /> And he and every thing was gone:<br /> And suddenly a
          ruffling breeze,<br /> (That would have rocked the sounding trees <br />
          Had aught of sylvan growth been there)<br /> Swept through the Hollow
          long and bare:<br /> The rain rushed down&mdash;the road was battered,<br />
          As with the force of billows shattered;<br /> The horses are dismayed,
          nor know <br /> Whether they should stand or go;<br /> And Benjamin is
          groping near them,<br /> Sees nothing, and can scarcely hear them.<br />
          He is astounded,&mdash;wonder not,&mdash;<br /> With such a charge in
          such a spot; <br /> Astounded in the mountain gap<br /> With
          thunder-peals, clap after clap,<br /> Close-treading on the silent
          flashes&mdash;<br /> And somewhere, as he thinks, by crashes<br /> Among
          the rocks; with weight of rain, <br /> And sullen motions long and
          slow,<br /> That to a dreary distance go&mdash;<br /> Till, breaking in
          upon the dying strain,<br /> A rending o'er his head begins the fray
          again.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, uncertain what to do, <br /> And oftentimes
          compelled to halt,<br /> The horses cautiously pursue<br /> Their way,
          without mishap or fault;<br /> And now have reached that pile of
          stones,<br /> Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones; <br /> He who had
          once supreme command,<br /> Last king of rocky Cumberland;<br /> His
          bones, and those of all his Power,<br /> Slain here in a disastrous
          hour!<br /><br /> When, passing through this narrow strait, <br /> Stony,
          and dark, and desolate,<br /> Benjamin can faintly hear<br /> A voice
          that comes from some one near,<br /> A female voice:&mdash;"Whoe'er you
          be,<br /> Stop," it exclaimed, "and pity me!" <br /> And, less in pity
          than in wonder,<br /> Amid the darkness and the thunder,<br /> The
          Waggoner, with prompt command,<br /> Summons his horses to a stand.<br /><br />
          While, with increasing agitation, <br /> The Woman urged her
          supplication,<br /> In rueful words, with sobs between&mdash;<br /> The
          voice of tears that fell unseen;<br /> There came a flash&mdash;a
          startling glare,<br /> And all Seat-Sandal was laid bare! <br /> 'Tis
          not a time for nice suggestion,<br /> And Benjamin, without a question,<br />
          Taking her for some way-worn rover,<br /> Said, "Mount, and get you
          under cover!"<br /> Another voice, in tone as hoarse <br /> As a swoln
          brook with rugged course,<br /> Cried out, "Good brother, why so fast?<br />
          I've had a glimpse of you&mdash;'avast!'<br /> Or, since it suits you
          to be civil,<br /> Take her at once&mdash;for good and evil!" <br /><br />
          "It is my Husband," softly said<br /> The Woman, as if half afraid:<br />
          By this time she was snug within,<br /> Through help of honest
          Benjamin;<br /> She and her Babe, which to her breast <br /> With
          thankfulness the Mother pressed;<br /> And now the same strong voice
          more near<br /> Said cordially, "My Friend, what cheer?<br /> Rough
          doings these! as God's my judge,<br /> The sky owes somebody a grudge!
          <br /> We've had in half an hour or less<br /> A twelvemonth's terror
          and distress!"<br /><br /> Then Benjamin entreats the Man<br /> Would
          mount, too, quickly as he can:<br /> The Sailor&mdash;Sailor now no
          more, <br /> But such he had been heretofore&mdash;<br /> To courteous
          Benjamin replied,<br /> "Go you your way, and mind not me;<br /> For I
          must have, whate'er betide,<br /> My Ass and fifty things beside,&mdash;
          <br /> Go, and I'll follow speedily!"<br /><br /> The Waggon moves&mdash;and
          with its load<br /> Descends along the sloping road;<br /> And the rough
          Sailor instantly<br /> Turns to a little tent hard by: <br /> For when,
          at closing-in of day,<br /> The family had come that way,<br /> Green
          pasture and the soft warm air<br /> Tempted them to settle there.&mdash;<br />
          Green is the grass for beast to graze, <br /> Around the stones of
          Dunmail-raise!<br /><br /> The Sailor gathers up his bed,<br /> Takes
          down the canvass overhead;<br /> And, after farewell to the place,<br />
          A parting word&mdash;though not of grace, <br /> Pursues, with Ass and
          all his store,<br /> The way the Waggon went before.

          If Wytheburn's modest House of prayer,<br /> As lowly as the lowliest
          dwelling,<br /> Had, with its belfry's humble stock, <br /> A little
          pair that hang in air,<br /> Been mistress also of a clock,<br /> (And
          one, too, not in crazy plight)<br /> Twelve strokes that clock would
          have been telling<br /> Under the brow of old Helvellyn&mdash; <br />
          Its bead-roll of midnight,<br /> Then, when the Hero of my tale<br />
          Was passing by, and, down the vale<br /> (The vale now silent, hushed I
          ween<br /> As if a storm had never been) <br /> Proceeding with a mind
          at ease;<br /> While the old Familiar of the seas<br /> Intent to use
          his utmost haste,<br /> Gained ground upon the Waggon fast,<br /> And
          gives another lusty cheer; <br /> For spite of rumbling of the wheels,<br />
          A welcome greeting he can hear;&mdash;<br /> It is a fiddle in its glee<br />
          Dinning from the <b>Cherry Tree</b>!<br /><br /> Thence the sound&mdash;the
          light is there&mdash; <br /> As Benjamin is now aware,<br /> Who, to his
          inward thoughts confined,<br /> Had almost reached the festive door,<br />
          When, startled by the Sailor's roar,<br /> He hears a sound and sees
          the light, <br /> And in a moment calls to mind<br /> That 'tis the
          village <b>Merry-Night</b>!<br /><br /> Although before in no dejection,<br />
          At this insidious recollection<br /> His heart with sudden joy is
          filled,&mdash; <br /> His ears are by the music thrilled,<br /> His eyes
          take pleasure in the road<br /> Glittering before him bright and broad;<br />
          And Benjamin is wet and cold,<br /> And there are reasons manifold
          <br /> That make the good, tow'rds which he's yearning,<br /> Look
          fairly like a lawful earning.<br /><br /> Nor has thought time to come
          and go,<br /> To vibrate between yes and no;<br /> For, cries the
          Sailor, "Glorious chance <br /> That blew us hither!&mdash;let him
          dance,<br /> Who can or will!&mdash;my honest soul,<br /> Our treat
          shall be a friendly bowl!"<br /> He draws him to the door&mdash;"Come
          in,<br /> Come, come," cries he to Benjamin! <br /> And Benjamin&mdash;ah,
          woe is me!<br /> Gave the word&mdash;the horses heard<br /> And halted,
          though reluctantly.<br /><br /> "Blithe souls and lightsome hearts have
          we,<br /> Feasting at the <b>Cherry Tree</b>!" <br /> This was the
          outside proclamation,<br /> This was the inside salutation;<br /> What
          bustling&mdash;jostling&mdash;high and low!<br /> A universal overflow!<br />
          What tankards foaming from the tap! <br /> What store of cakes in every
          lap!<br /> What thumping&mdash;stumping&mdash;overhead!<br /> The
          thunder had not been more busy:<br /> With such a stir you would have
          said,<br /> This little place may well be dizzy! <br /> 'Tis who can
          dance with greatest vigour&mdash;<br /> 'Tis what can be most prompt
          and eager;<br /> As if it heard the fiddle's call,<br /> The pewter
          clatters on the wall;<br /> The very bacon shows its feeling, <br />
          Swinging from the smoky ceiling!<br /><br /> A steaming bowl, a blazing
          fire,<br /> What greater good can heart desire?<br /> 'Twere worth a
          wise man's while to try<br /> The utmost anger of the sky: <br /> To <i>seek</i>
          for thoughts of a gloomy cast,<br /> If such the bright amends at last.<br />
          Now should you say I judge amiss,<br /> The <b>Cherry Tree</b> shows
          proof of this;<br /> For soon of all the happy there, <br /> Our
          Travellers are the happiest pair;<br /> All care with Benjamin is gone&mdash;<br />
          A C&aelig;sar past the Rubicon!<br /> He thinks not of his long, long
          strife;&mdash;<br /> The Sailor, Man by nature gay, <br /> Hath no
          resolves to throw away;<br /> And he hath now forgot his Wife,<br />
          Hath quite forgotten her&mdash;or may be<br /> Thinks her the luckiest
          soul on earth,<br /> Within that warm and peaceful berth, <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under cover,<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Terror over,<br /> Sleeping by her sleeping Baby.<br /><br /> With bowl
          that sped from hand to hand,<br /> The gladdest of the gladsome band,
          <br /> Amid their own delight and fun,<br /> They hear&mdash;when every
          dance is done,<br /> When every whirling bout is o'er&mdash;<br /> The
          fiddle's <i>squeak</i>&mdash;that call to bliss,<br /> Ever followed by
          a kiss; <br /> They envy not the happy lot,<br /> But enjoy their own
          the more!<br /><br /> While thus our jocund Travellers fare,<br /> Up
          springs the Sailor from his chair&mdash;<br /> Limps (for I might have
          told before <br /> That he was lame) across the floor&mdash;<br /> Is
          gone&mdash;returns&mdash;and with a prize;<br /> With what?&mdash;a
          Ship of lusty size;<br /> A gallant stately Man-of-war,<br /> Fixed on a
          smoothly-sliding car. <br /> Surprise to all, but most surprise<br /> To
          Benjamin, who rubs his eyes,<br /> Not knowing that he had befriended<br />
          A Man so gloriously attended! <br /><br /> "This," cries the Sailor, "a
          Third-rate is&mdash;<br /> Stand back, and you shall see her gratis!<br />
          This was the Flag-ship at the Nile,<br /> The Vanguard&mdash;you may
          smirk and smile,<br /> But, pretty Maid, if you look near,<br /> You'll
          find you've much in little here! <br /> A nobler ship did never swim,<br />
          And you shall see her in full trim:<br /> I'll set, my friends, to do
          you honour,<br /> Set every inch of sail upon her."<br /> So said, so
          done; and masts, sails, yards, <br /> He names them all; and interlards<br />
          His speech with uncouth terms of art,<br /> Accomplished in the
          showman's part;<br /> And then, as from a sudden check,<br /> Cries out&mdash;"'Tis
          there, the quarter-deck <br /> On which brave Admiral Nelson stood&mdash;<br />
          A sight that would have roused your blood!<br /> One eye he had, which,
          bright as ten,<br /> Burned like a fire among his men;<br /> Let this be
          land, and that be sea, <br /> Here lay the French&mdash;and <i>thus</i>
          came we!"<br /><br /> Hushed was by this the fiddle's sound,<br /> The
          dancers all were gathered round,<br /> And, such the stillness of the
          house,<br /> You might have heard a nibbling mouse; <br /> While,
          borrowing helps where'er he may,<br /> The Sailor through the story
          runs<br /> Of ships to ships and guns to guns;<br /> And does his utmost
          to display<br /> The dismal conflict, and the might <br /> And terror of
          that marvellous night!<br /> "A bowl, a bowl of double measure,"<br />
          Cries Benjamin, "a draught of length,<br /> To Nelson, England's pride
          and treasure,<br /> Her bulwark and her tower of strength!" <br /> When
          Benjamin had seized the bowl,<br /> The mastiff, from beneath the
          waggon,<br /> Where he lay, watchful as a dragon,<br /> Rattled his
          chain;&mdash;'twas all in vain,<br /> For Benjamin, triumphant soul!<br />
          He heard the monitory growl;<br /> Heard&mdash;and in opposition
          quaffed<br /> A deep, determined, desperate draught!<br /> Nor did the
          battered Tar forget,<br /> Or flinch from what he deemed his debt:
          <br /> Then, like a hero crowned with laurel,<br /> Back to her place
          the ship he led;<br /> Wheeled her back in full apparel;<br /> And so,
          flag flying at mast head,<br /> Re-yoked her to the Ass:&mdash;anon,
          <br /> Cries Benjamin, "We must be gone."<br /> Thus, after two hours'
          hearty stay,<br /> Again behold them on their way!

          Right gladly had the horses stirred,<br /> When they the wished-for
          greeting heard,<br /> The whip's loud notice from the door,<br /> That
          they were free to move once more.<br /> You think, those doings must
          have bred<br /> In them disheartening doubts and dread;<br /> No, not a
          horse of all the eight,<br /> Although it be a moonless night,<br />
          Fears either for himself or freight;<br /> For this they know (and let
          it hide,<br /> In part, the offences of their guide)<br /> That
          Benjamin, with clouded brains,<br /> Is worth the best with all their
          pains;<br /> And, if they had a prayer to make,<br /> The prayer would
          be that they may take<br /> With him whatever comes in course,<br /> The
          better fortune or the worse;<br /> That no one else may have business
          near them,<br /> And, drunk or sober, he may steer them.<br /><br /> So,
          forth in dauntless mood they fare,<br /> And with them goes the
          guardian pair.<br /><br /> Now, heroes, for the true commotion,<br /> The
          triumph of your late devotion!<br /> Can aught on earth impede delight,<br />
          Still mounting to a higher height;<br /> And higher still&mdash;a
          greedy flight!<br /> Can any low-born care pursue her,<br /> Can any
          mortal clog come to her?<br /> No notion have they&mdash;not a thought,<br />
          That is from joyless regions brought!<br /> And, while they coast the
          silent lake,<br /> Their inspiration I partake;<br /> Share their
          empyreal spirits&mdash;yea,<br /> With their enraptured vision, see&mdash;<br />
          O fancy&mdash;what a jubilee!<br /> What shifting pictures&mdash;clad
          in gleams<br /> Of colour bright as feverish dreams!<br /> Earth,
          spangled sky, and lake serene,<br /> Involved and restless all&mdash;a
          scene<br /> Pregnant with mutual exaltation,<br /> Rich change, and
          multiplied creation!<br /> This sight to me the Muse imparts;&mdash;<br />
          And then, what kindness in their hearts!<br /> What tears of rapture,
          what vow-making,<br /> Profound entreaties, and hand-shaking!<br /> What
          solemn, vacant, interlacing,<br /> As if they'd fall asleep embracing!<br />
          Then, in the turbulence of glee,<br /> And in the excess of amity,<br />
          Says Benjamin, "That Ass of thine,<br /> He spoils thy sport, and
          hinders mine:<br /> If he were tethered to the waggon,<br /> He'd drag
          as well what he is dragging;<br /> And we, as brother should with
          brother,<br /> Might trudge it alongside each other!"<br /><br />
          Forthwith, obedient to command,<br /> The horses made a quiet stand;<br />
          And to the waggon's skirts was tied<br /> The Creature, by the
          Mastiff's side,<br /> The Mastiff wondering, and perplext<br /> With
          dread of what will happen next;<br /> And thinking it but sorry cheer,<br />
          To have such company so near!<br /><br /> This new arrangement made, the
          Wain<br /> Through the still night proceeds again;<br /> No Moon hath
          risen her light to lend;<br /> But indistinctly may be kenned<br /> The
          <b>Vanguard</b>, following close behind,<br /> Sails spread, as if to
          catch the wind!<br /><br /> "Thy wife and child are snug and warm,<br />
          Thy ship will travel without harm;<br /> I like," said Benjamin, "her
          shape and stature:<br /> And this of mine&mdash;this bulky creature<br />
          Of which I have the steering&mdash;this,<br /> Seen fairly, is not much
          amiss!<br /> We want your streamers, friend, you know;<br /> But,
          altogether as we go,<br /> We make a kind of handsome show!<br /> Among
          these hills, from first to last,<br /> We've weathered many a furious
          blast;<br /> Hard passage forcing on, with head<br /> Against the storm,
          and canvass spread.<br /> I hate a boaster; but to thee<br /> Will
          say't, who know'st both land and sea,<br /> The unluckiest hulk that
          stems the brine<br /> Is hardly worse beset than mine,<br /> When
          cross-winds on her quarter beat;<br /> And, fairly lifted from my feet,<br />
          I stagger onward&mdash;heaven knows how;<br /> But not so pleasantly as
          now:<br /> Poor pilot I, by snows confounded,<br /> And many a foundrous
          pit surrounded!<br /> Yet here we are, by night and day<br /> Grinding
          through rough and smooth our way;<br /> Through foul and fair our task
          fulfilling;<br /> And long shall be so yet&mdash;God willing!"<br /><br />
          "Ay," said the Tar, "through fair and foul&mdash;<br /> But save us
          from yon screeching owl!"<br /> That instant was begun a fray<br />
          Which called their thoughts another way:<br /> The mastiff,
          ill-conditioned carl!<br /> What must he do but growl and snarl,<br />
          Still more and more dissatisfied<br /> With the meek comrade at his
          side!<br /> Till, not incensed though put to proof,<br /> The Ass,
          uplifting a hind hoof,<br /> Salutes the Mastiff on the head;<br /> And
          so were better manners bred,<br /> And all was calmed and quieted.<br /><br />
          "Yon screech-owl," says the Sailor, turning<br /> Back to his former
          cause of mourning,<br /> "Yon owl!&mdash;pray God that all be well!<br />
          'Tis worse than any funeral bell;<br /> As sure as I've the gift of
          sight,<br /> We shall be meeting ghosts to-night!"<br /> &mdash;Said
          Benjamin, "This whip shall lay<br /> A thousand, if they cross our way.<br />
          I know that Wanton's noisy station,<br /> I know him and his
          occupation;<br /> The jolly bird hath learned his cheer<br /> Upon the
          banks of Windermere;<br /> Where a tribe of them make merry,<br />
          Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry;<br /> Hallooing from an open
          throat,<br /> Like travellers shouting for a boat.<br /> &mdash;The
          tricks he learned at Windermere<br /> This vagrant owl is playing here&mdash;<br />
          That is the worst of his employment:<br /> He's at the top of his
          enjoyment!"<br /><br /> This explanation stilled the alarm,<br /> Cured
          the foreboder like a charm;<br /> This, and the manner, and the voice,<br />
          Summoned the Sailor to rejoice;<br /> His heart is up&mdash;he fears no
          evil<br /> From life or death, from man or devil;<br /> He wheels&mdash;and,
          making many stops,<br /> Brandished his crutch against the mountain
          tops;<br /> And, while he talked of blows and scars,<br /> Benjamin,
          among the stars,<br /> Beheld a dancing&mdash;and a glancing;<br /> Such
          retreating and advancing<br /> As, I ween, was never seen<br /> In
          bloodiest battle since the days of Mars!

          Thus they, with freaks of proud delight,<br /> Beguile the remnant of
          the night;<br /> And many a snatch of jovial song<br /> Regales them as
          they wind along;<br /> While to the music, from on high,<br /> The
          echoes make a glad reply.&mdash;<br /> But the sage Muse the revel
          heeds<br /> No farther than her story needs;<br /> Nor will she
          servilely attend<br /> The loitering journey to its end.<br /> &mdash;Blithe
          spirits of her own impel<br /> The Muse, who scents the morning air,<br />
          To take of this transported pair<br /> A brief and unreproved farewell;<br />
          To quit the slow-paced waggon's side,<br /> And wander down yon
          hawthorn dell,<br /> With murmuring Greta for her guide.<br /> &mdash;There
          doth she ken the awful form<br /> Of Raven-crag&mdash;black as a storm&mdash;<br />
          Glimmering through the twilight pale;<br /> And Ghimmer-crag, his tall
          twin brother,<br /> Each peering forth to meet the other:&mdash;<br />
          And, while she roves through St. John's Vale,<br /> Along the smooth
          unpathwayed plain,<br /> By sheep-track or through cottage lane,<br />
          Where no disturbance comes to intrude<br /> Upon the pensive solitude,<br />
          Her unsuspecting eye, perchance,<br /> With the rude shepherd's
          favoured glance,<br /> Beholds the faeries in array,<br /> Whose
          party-coloured garments gay<br /> The silent company betray:<br /> Red,
          green, and blue; a moment's sight!<br /> For Skiddaw-top with rosy
          light<br /> Is touched&mdash;and all the band take flight.<br /> &mdash;Fly
          also, Muse! and from the dell<br /> Mount to the ridge of Nathdale
          Fell;<br /> Thence, look thou forth o'er wood and lawn<br /> Hoar with
          the frost-like dews of dawn;<br /> Across yon meadowy bottom look,<br />
          Where close fogs hide their parent brook;<br /> And see, beyond that
          hamlet small,<br /> The ruined towers of Threlkeld-hall,<br /> Lurking
          in a double shade,<br /> By trees and lingering twilight made!<br />
          There, at Blencathara's rugged feet,<br /> Sir Lancelot gave a safe
          retreat<br /> To noble Clifford; from annoy<br /> Concealed the
          persecuted boy,<br /> Well pleased in rustic garb to feed<br /> His
          flock, and pipe on shepherd's reed<br /> Among this multitude of hills,<br />
          Crags, woodlands, waterfalls, and rills;<br /> Which soon the morning
          shall enfold,<br /> From east to west, in ample vest<br /> Of massy
          gloom and radiance bold.<br /><br /> The mists, that o'er the
          streamlet's bed<br /> Hung low, begin to rise and spread;<br /> Even
          while I speak, their skirts of grey<br /> Are smitten by a silver ray;<br />
          And lo!&mdash;up Castrigg's naked steep<br /> (Where, smoothly urged,
          the vapours sweep<br /> Along&mdash;and scatter and divide,<br /> Like
          fleecy clouds self-multiplied)<br /> The stately waggon is ascending,<br />
          With faithful Benjamin attending,<br /> Apparent now beside his team&mdash;<br />
          Now lost amid a glittering steam:<br /> And with him goes his
          Sailor-friend,<br /> By this time near their journey's end;<br /> And,
          after their high-minded riot,<br /> Sickening into thoughtful quiet;<br />
          As if the morning's pleasant hour,<br /> Had for their joys a killing
          power.<br /> And, sooth, for Benjamin a vein<br /> Is opened of still
          deeper pain,<br /> As if his heart by notes were stung<br /> From out
          the lowly hedge-rows flung;<br /> As if the warbler lost in light<br />
          Reproved his soarings of the night,<br /> In strains of rapture pure
          and holy<br /> Upbraided his distempered folly.<br /><br /> Drooping is
          he, his step is dull;<br /> But the horses stretch and pull;<br /> With
          increasing vigour climb,<br /> Eager to repair lost time;<br /> Whether,
          by their own desert,<br /> Knowing what cause there is for shame,<br />
          They are labouring to avert<br /> As much as may be of the blame,<br />
          Which, they foresee, must soon alight<br /> Upon <i>his</i> head, whom,
          in despite<br /> Of all his failings, they love best;<br /> Whether for
          him they are distrest,<br /> Or, by length of fasting roused,<br /> Are
          impatient to be housed:<br /> Up against the hill they strain<br />
          Tugging at the iron chain,<br /> Tugging all with might and main,<br />
          Last and foremost, every horse<br /> To the utmost of his force!<br />
          And the smoke and respiration,<br /> Rising like an exhalation,<br />
          Blend with the mist&mdash;a moving shroud<br /> To form, an
          undissolving cloud;<br /> Which, with slant ray, the merry sun<br />
          Takes delight to play upon.<br /> Never golden-haired Apollo,<br />
          Pleased some favourite chief to follow<br /> Through accidents of peace
          or war,<br /> In a perilous moment threw<br /> Around the object of his
          care<br /> Veil of such celestial hue;<br /> Interposed so bright a
          screen&mdash;<br /> Him and his enemies between!<br /><br /> Alas! what
          boots it?&mdash;who can hide,<br /> When the malicious Fates are bent<br />
          On working out an ill intent?<br /> Can destiny be turned aside?<br />
          No&mdash;sad progress of my story!<br /> Benjamin, this outward glory<br />
          Cannot shield thee from thy Master,<br /> Who from Keswick has pricked
          forth,<br /> Sour and surly as the north;<br /> And, in fear of some
          disaster,<br /> Comes to give what help he may,<br /> And to hear what
          thou canst say;<br /> If, as needs he must forebode,<br /> Thou hast
          been loitering on the road!<br /> His fears, his doubts, may now take
          flight&mdash;<br /> The wishcd-for object is in sight;<br /> Yet, trust
          the Muse, it rather hath<br /> Stirred him up to livelier wrath;<br />
          Which he stifles, moody man!<br /> With all the patience that he can;<br />
          To the end that, at your meeting,<br /> He may give thee decent
          greeting.<br /><br /> There he is&mdash;resolved to stop,<br /> Till the
          waggon gains the top;<br /> But stop he cannot&mdash;must advance:<br />
          Him Benjamin, with lucky glance,<br /> Espies&mdash;and instantly is
          ready,<br /> Self-collected, poised, and steady:<br /> And, to be the
          better seen,<br /> Issues from his radiant shroud,<br /> From his
          close-attending cloud,<br /> With careless air and open mien.<br />
          Erect his port, and firm his going;<br /> So struts yon cock that now
          is crowing;<br /> And the morning light in grace<br /> Strikes upon his
          lifted face,<br /> Hurrying the pallid hue away<br /> That might his
          trespasses betray.<br /> But what can all avail to clear him,<br /> Or
          what need of explanation,<br /> Parley or interrogation?<br /> For the
          Master sees, alas!<br /> That unhappy Figure near him,<br /> Limping
          o'er the dewy grass,<br /> Where the road it fringes, sweet,<br /> Soft
          and cool to way-worn feet;<br /> And, O indignity! an Ass,<br /> By his
          noble Mastiffs side,<br /> Tethered to the waggon's tail:<br /> And the
          ship, in all her pride,<br /> Following after in full sail!<br /> Not to
          speak of babe and mother;<br /> Who, contented with each other,<br />
          And snug as birds in leafy arbour,<br /> Find, within, a blessed
          harbour!<br /><br /> With eager eyes the Master pries;<br /> Looks in and
          out, and through and through;<br /> Says nothing&mdash;till at last he
          spies<br /> A wound upon the Mastiff's head,<br /> A wound, where
          plainly might be read<br /> What feats an Ass's hoof can do!<br /> But
          drop the rest:&mdash;this aggravation,<br /> This complicated
          provocation,<br /> A hoard of grievances unsealed;<br /> All past
          forgiveness it repealed;<br /> And thus, and through distempered blood<br />
          On both sides, Benjamin the good,<br /> The patient, and the
          tender-hearted,<br /> Was from his team and waggon parted;<br /> When
          duty of that day was o'er,<br /> Laid down his whip&mdash;and served no
          more.&mdash;<br /> Nor could the waggon long survive,<br /> Which
          Benjamin had ceased to drive:<br /> It lingered on;&mdash;guide after
          guide<br /> Ambitiously the office tried;<br /> But each unmanageable
          hill<br /> Called for <i>his</i> patience and <i>his</i> skill;&mdash;<br />
          And sure it is, that through this night,<br /> And what the morning
          brought to light,<br /> Two losses had we to sustain,<br /> We lost both
          <b>Waggoner</b> and <b>Wain</b>!<br /><br />
          <hr />
          <br /> <br /> Accept, O Friend, for praise or blame,<br /> The gift of
          this adventurous song;<br /> A record which I dared to frame,<br />
          Though timid scruples checked me long;<br /> They checked me&mdash;and
          I left the theme<br /> Untouched;&mdash;in spite of many a gleam<br />
          Of fancy which thereon was shed,<br /> Like pleasant sunbeams shifting
          still<br /> Upon the side of a distant hill:<br /> But Nature might not
          be gainsaid;<br /> For what I have and what I miss<br /> I sing of
          these;&mdash;it makes my bliss!<br /> Nor is it I who play the part,<br />
          But a shy spirit in my heart,<br /> That comes and goes&mdash;will
          sometimes leap<br /> From hiding-places ten years deep;<br /> Or haunts
          me with familiar face,<br /> Returning, like a ghost unlaid,<br /> Until
          the debt I owe be paid.<br /> Forgive me, then; for I had been<br /> On
          friendly terms with this Machine:<br /> In him, while he was wont to
          trace<br /> Our roads, through many a long year's space,<br /> A living
          almanack had we;<br /> We had a speaking diary,<br /> That in this
          uneventful place,<br /> Gave to the days a mark and name<br /> By which
          we knew them when they came.<br /> &mdash;Yes, I, and all about me
          here,<br /> Through all the changes of the year,<br /> Had seen him
          through the mountains go,<br /> In pomp of mist or pomp of snow,<br />
          Majestically huge and slow:<br /> Or, with a milder grace adorning<br />
          The landscape of a summer's morning;<br /> While Grasmere smoothed her
          liquid plain<br /> The moving image to detain;<br /> And mighty
          Fairfield, with a chime<br /> Of echoes, to his march kept time;<br />
          When little other business stirred,<br /> And little other sound was
          heard;<br /> In that delicious hour of balm,<br /> Stillness, solitude,
          and calm,<br /> While yet the valley is arrayed,<br /> On this side with
          a sober shade;<br /> On that is prodigally bright&mdash;<br /> Crag,
          lawn, and wood&mdash;with rosy light.<br /> &mdash;But most of all,
          thou lordly Wain!<br /> I wish to have thee here again,<br /> When
          windows flap and chimney roars,<br /> And all is dismal out of doors;<br />
          And, sitting by my fire, I see<br /> Eight sorry carts, no less a
          train!<br /> Unworthy successors of thee,<br /> Come straggling through
          the wind and rain:<br /> And oft, as they pass slowly on,<br /> Beneath
          my windows, one by one,<br /> See, perched upon the naked height<br />
          The summit of a cumbrous freight,<br /> A single traveller&mdash;and
          there<br /> Another; then perhaps a pair&mdash;<br /> The lame, the
          sickly, and the old;<br /> Men, women, heartless with the cold;<br />
          And babes in wet and starveling plight;<br /> Which once, be weather as
          it might,<br /> Had still a nest within a nest,<br /> Thy shelter&mdash;and
          their mother's breast!<br /> Then most of all, then far the most,<br />
          Do I regret what we have lost;<br /> Am grieved for that unhappy sin<br />
          Which robbed us of good Benjamin;&mdash;<br /> And of his stately
          Charge, which none<br /> Could keep alive when He was gone!<br /> <br />

        little more than a cottage (the only one), with clean well-sanded floor,
        and rush-bottomed chairs: the landlady, good old soul, one day afraid of
        burdening me with some old coppers, insisted on retaining them till I
        should return from an uphill walk, when they were duly tendered to me.
        Here I learnt many particulars of Hartley Coleridge, dead shortly
        before, who had been a great favourite with the host and hostess. The
        grave of Wordsworth was at that time barely grassed over."

      after the event that forms the subject of the foregoing poem, in company
      with my friend, the late Mr. Coleridge, I happened to fall in with the
      person to whom the name of Benjamin is given. Upon our expressing regret
      that we had not, for a long time, seen upon the road either him or his
      waggon, he said:&mdash;"They could not do without me; and as to the man

        knows his ground, and hopes to find<br /> A spot with all things to his

      <br /> <br /> <a name="23n4"></a><i>Editor's Note:</i> &nbsp; There is no
      poem more closely identified with the Grasmere district of the English
      Lakes&mdash;and with the road from Grasmere to Keswick&mdash;than <i>The
      Waggoner</i> is, and in none are the topographical allusions more minute
      and faithful.<br /> <br /> Wordsworth seemed at a loss to know in what
      "class" of his poems to place <i>The Waggoner;</i> and his frequent
      changes&mdash;removing it from one group to another&mdash;shew the
      artificial character of these classes. Thus, in the edition of 1820, it
      stood first among the "Poems of the Fancy." In 1827 it was the last of the
      "Poems founded on the Affections." In 1832 it was reinstated among the
      "Poems of the Fancy." In 1836 it had a place of its own, and was inserted
      between the "Poems of the Fancy" and those "Founded on the Affections;"
      while in 1845 it was sent back to its original place among the "Poems of
      the Fancy;" although in the table of contents it was printed as an
      independent poem, closing the series.<br /> <br /> The original text of <i>The
      Waggoner</i> underwent little change, till the year 1836, when it was
      carefully revised, and altered throughout. The final edition of 1845,
      however, reverted, in many instances&mdash;especially in the first canto&mdash;to
      the original text of 1819.<br /> <br /> As this poem was dedicated to
      Charles Lamb, it may be of interest to note that, some six months
      afterwards, Lamb presented Wordsworth with a copy of the first edition of
      'Paradise Regained' (the edition of 1671), writing on it the following
      sentence,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Charles Lamb, to the best knower of Milton, and therefore the worthiest
        occupant of this pleasant edition.&mdash;Jan. 2nd, 1820."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The opening stanzas are unrivalled in their description of a sultry June
      evening, with a thunder-storm imminent.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        ' 'Tis spent&mdash;this burning day of June!<br /> Soft darkness o'er its
        latest gleams is stealing;<br /> The buzzing dor-hawk, round and round,
        is wheeling,&mdash;<br /> That solitary bird<br /> Is all that can be
        heard<br /> In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon!<br /> ...<br />
        ... <br /> The mountains against heaven's grave weight<br /> Rise up, and
        grow to wondrous height.<br /> The air, as in a lion's den,<br /> Is close
        and hot;&mdash;and now and then<br /> Comes a tired and sultry breeze<br />
        With a haunting and a panting,<br /> Like the stifling of disease;<br />
        But the dews allay the heat,<br /> And the silence makes it sweet.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The Waggoner takes what is now the middle road, of the three leading from
      Rydal to Grasmere (see the note to <i>The Primrose of the Rock</i>). The
      "craggy hill" referred to in the lines
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'Now he leaves the lower ground,<br /> And up the craggy hill ascending<br />
        ... <br /> Steep the way and wearisome,'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      is the road from Rydal Quarry up to White Moss Common, with the Glowworm
      rock on the right, and the "two heath-clad rocks," referred to in the last
      of the "Poems on the Naming of Places," on the left. He next passes "The
      Wishing Gate" on the left, John's Grove on the right, and descends by Dove
      Cottage&mdash;where Wordsworth lived&mdash;to Grasmere.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        '... at the bottom of the brow,<br /> Where once the <b>Dove</b> and <b>Olive-Bough</b><br />
        Offered a greeting of good ale<br /> To all who entered Grasmere Vale;<br />
        And called on him who must depart<br /> To leave it with a jovial heart;<br />
        There, where the <b>Dove</b> and <b>Olive-Bough</b><br /> Once hung, a
        Poet harbours now,<br /> A simple water-drinking Bard.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      He goes through Grasmere, passes the Swan Inn, '
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        He knows it to his cost, good Man!<br /> Who does not know the famous <b>Swan</b>?<br />
        Object uncouth! and yet our boast,<br /> For it was painted by the Host;<br />
        His own conceit the figure planned,<br /> 'Twas coloured all by his own
        hand.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As early as 1819, when the poem was first published, "this rude piece of
      self-taught art had been supplanted" by a more pretentious figure. The
      Waggoner passes the Swan,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'And now the conqueror essays<br /> The long ascent of Dunmail-raise.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As he proceeds, the storm gathers, and "struggles to get free." Road,
      hill, and sky are dark; and he barely sees the well-known rocks at the
      summit of Helm-crag, where two figures seem to sit, like those on the
      Cobbler, near Arrochar, in Argyle.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'Black is the sky&mdash;and every hill,<br /> Up to the sky, is blacker
        still&mdash;<br /> Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room,<br /> Hung round
        and overhung with gloom;<br /> Save that above a single height<br /> Is to
        be seen a lurid light,<br /> Above Helm-crag&mdash;a streak half dead,<br />
        A burning of portentous red;<br /> And near that lurid light, full well<br />
        The <b>Astrologer</b>, sage Sidrophel,<br /> Where at his desk and book
        he sits,<br /> Puzzling aloft his curious wits;<br /> He whose domain is
        held in common<br /> With no one but the <b>Ancient Woman</b>,<br />
        Cowering beside her rifted cell,<br /> As if intent on magic spell;&mdash;<br />
        Dread pair, that, spite of wind and weather,<br /> Still sit upon
        Helm-crag together!'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      At the top of the "raise"&mdash;the water-shed between the vales of
      Grasmere and Wytheburn&mdash;he reaches the familiar pile of stones, at
      the boundary between the shires of Westmoreland and Cumberland.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        '... that pile of stones,<br /> Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones;<br />
        ...<br /> Green is the grass for beast to graze,<br /> Around the stones
        of Dunmail-raise!'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The allusion to Seat-Sandal laid bare by the flash of lightning, and the
      description, in the last canto, of the ascent of the Raise by the Waggoner
      on a summer morning, are as true to the spirit of the place as anything
      that Wordsworth has written. He tells his friend Lamb, fourteen years
      after he wrote the poem of <i>The Waggoner,</i>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'Yes, I, and all about me here,<br /> Through all the changes of the
        year,<br /> Had seen him through the mountains go,<br /> In pomp of mist
        or pomp of snow,<br /> Majestically huge and slow:<br /> Or, with a milder
        grace adorning<br /> The landscape of a summer's morning;<br /> While
        Grasmere smoothed her liquid plain<br /> The moving image to detain;<br />
        And mighty Fairfield, with a chime<br /> Of echoes, to his march kept
        time;<br /> When little other business stirred,<br /> And little other
        sound was heard;<br /> In that delicious hour of balm,<br /> Stillness,
        solitude, and calm,<br /> While yet the valley is arrayed,<br /> On this
        side with a sober shade;<br /> On that is prodigally bright&mdash;<br />
        Crag, lawn, and wood&mdash;with rosy light.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      From Dunmail-raise the Waggoner descends to Wytheburn. Externally,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        '... Wytheburn's modest House of prayer,<br /> As lowly as the lowliest
        dwelling,'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      remains very much as it was in 1805; but the primitive simplicity and
      "lowliness" of the chapel was changed by the addition a few years ago of
      an apse, by the removal of some of the old rafters, and by the reseating
      of the pews.<br /> <br /> The Cherry Tree Tavern, where "the village
      Merry-night" was being celebrated, still stands on the eastern or
      Helvellyn side of the road. It is now a farm-house; but it will be
      regarded with interest from the description of the rustic dance, which
      recalls ('longo intervallo') 'The Jolly Beggars' of Burns. After two
      hours' delay at the Cherry Tree, the Waggoner and Sailor "coast the silent
      lake" of Thirlmere, and pass the Rock of Names.<br /> <br /> This rock was,
      until lately, one of the most interesting memorials of Wordsworth and his
      friends that survived in the Lake District; but the vale of Thirlmere is
      now a Manchester water-tank, and the place which knew the Rock of Names
      now knows it no more. It was a sort of trysting place of the poets of
      Grasmere and Keswick&mdash;being nearly half-way between the two places&mdash;and
      there, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and other members of their households often
      met. When Coleridge left Grasmere for Keswick, the Wordsworths usually
      accompanied him as far as this rock; and they often met him there on his
      way over from Keswick to Grasmere. Compare the Hon. Mr. Justice
      Coleridge's Reminiscences. (<i>Memoirs of Wordsworth,</i> vol. ii. p.
      310.)<br /> <br /> The rock was on the right hand of the road, a little way
      past Waterhead, at the southern end of Thirlmere; and on it were cut the
      letters,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        W. W.<br /> M. H.<br /> D. W.<br /> S. T. C.<br /> J. W.<br /> S. H.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      the initials of William Wordsworth, Mary Hutchinson, Dorothy Wordsworth,
      Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Wordsworth, and Sarah Hutchinson. The
      Wordsworths settled at Grasmere at the close of the year 1799. As
      mentioned in a previous note, John Wordsworth lived with his brother and
      sister during most of that winter, and during the whole of the spring,
      summer, and autumn of 1800, leaving it finally on September 29, 1800.
      These names must therefore have been cut during the spring or summer of
      1800. There is no record of the occurrence, and no allusion to the rock,
      in Dorothy Wordsworth's <i>Grasmere Journal</i> of 1800. But that Journal,
      so far as I have seen it, begins on the 14th of May 1800. Almost every
      detail of the daily life and ways of the household at Dove Cottage is so
      minutely recorded in it, that I am convinced that this incident of the
      cutting of names in the Thirlmere Rock would have been mentioned, had it
      happened between the 14th of May and John Wordsworth's departure from
      Grasmere in September. Such references as this, for example, occur in the
      <i>Journal:</i>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Saturday, August 2.&mdash;William and Coleridge went to Keswick. John
        went with them to Wytheburn, and staid all day fishing."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I therefore infer that it was in the spring or early summer of 1800 that
      the names were cut.<br /> <br /> I may add that the late Dean of Westminster&mdash;Dean
      Stanley&mdash;took much interest in this Rock of Names; and doubt having
      been cast on the accuracy of the place and the genuineness of the
      inscriptions, in a letter from Dr. Fraser, then Bishop of Manchester,
      which he forwarded to me, he entered into the question with all the
      interest with which he was wont to track out details in the architecture
      or the history of a Church.<br /> <br /> There were few memorials connected
      with Wordsworth more worthy of preservation than this "upright mural block
      of stone." When one remembered that the initials on the rock were graven
      by the hands of William and John Wordsworth, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
      possibly with the assistance of Dorothy Wordsworth, the two Hutchinsons
      (Mary and Sarah), and that Wordsworth says of it,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'We worked until the Initials took<br /> Shapes that defied a scornful
        look,'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      this Thirlmere Rock was felt to be a far more interesting memento of the
      group of poets that used to meet beside it, than the Stone in the grounds
      of Rydal Mount, which was spared at Wordsworth's suit, "from some rude
      beauty of its own." There was simplicity, as well as strength, in the way
      in which the initials were cut. But the stone was afterwards desecrated by
      tourists, and others, who had the audacity to scratch their own names or
      initials upon it. In 1877 I wrote, "The rock is as yet wonderfully free
      from such; and its preservation is probably due to the dark olive-coloured
      moss, with which the 'pure water trickling down' has covered the face of
      the 'mural block,' and thus secured it from observation, even on that
      highway;" but I found in the summer of 1882 that several other names had
      been ruthlessly added. When the Manchester Thirlmere scheme was finally
      resolved upon, an effort was made to remove the Stone, with the view of
      its being placed higher up the hill on the side of the new roadway. In the
      course of this attempt, the Stone was broken to pieces.<br /> <br /> There
      is a very good drawing of "The Rock of Names" by Mr. Harry Goodwin, in <i>Through
      the Wordsworth Country, 1892</i>.<br /> <br /> "The Muse" takes farewell of
      the Waggoner as he is proceeding with the Sailor and his quaint model of
      the <i>Vanguard</i> along the road toward Keswick. She "scents the morning
      air," and
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'Quits the slow-paced waggon's side,<br /> To wander down yon hawthorn
        dell,<br /> With murmuring Greta for her guide.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The "hawthorn dell" is the upper part of the Vale of St. John.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        '&mdash;There doth she ken the awful form<br /> Of Raven-crag&mdash;black
        as a storm&mdash;<br /> Glimmering through the twilight pale;<br /> And
        Ghimmer-crag, his tall twin brother,<br /> Each peering forth to meet the
        other.'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Raven-crag is well known,&mdash;H.C. Robinson writes of it in his <i>Diary</i>
      in 1818, as "the most significant of the crags at a spot where there is
      not one insignificant,"&mdash;a rock on the western side of Thirlmere,
      where the Greta issues from the lake. But there is no rock in the district
      now called by the name of Ghimmer-crag, or the crag of the Ewe-lamb. I am
      inclined to think that Wordsworth referred to the "Fisher-crag" of the
      Ordnance Survey and the Guide Books. No other rock round Thirlmere can
      with any accuracy be called the "tall twin brother" of Raven-crag:
      certainly not Great How, nor any spur of High Seat or Bleaberry Fell.
      Fisher-crag resembles Raven-crag, as seen from Thirlmere Bridge, or from
      the high road above it; and it is somewhat remarkable that Green&mdash;in
      his Guide to the Lakes (a volume which the poet possessed)&mdash;makes use
      of the same expression as that which Wordsworth adopts regarding these two
      crags, Raven and Fisher.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The margin of the lake on the Dalehead side has its charms of wood and
        water; and Fischer Crag, twin brother to Raven Crag, is no bad object,
        when taken near the island called Buck's Holm"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      (<i>A Description of Sixty Studies from Nature</i>, by William Green of
      Ambleside, 1810, p. 57). I cannot find any topographical allusion to a
      Ghimmer-crag in contemporary local writers. Clarke, in his <i>Survey of
      the Lakes</i>, does not mention it.<br /> <br /> The Castle Rock, in the
      Vale of Legberthwaite, between High Fell and Great How, is the fairy
      castle of Sir Walter Scott's 'Bridal of Triermain'. "Nathdale Fell" is the
      ridge between Naddle Vale (Nathdale Vale) and that of St. John, now known
      as High Rigg. The old Hall of Threlkeld has long been in a state of
      ruinous dilapidation, the only habitable part of it having been for many
      years converted into a farmhouse. The remaining local allusions in <i>The
      Waggoner</i> are obvious enough: Castrigg is the shortened form of
      Castlerigg, the ridge between Naddle Valley and Keswick.<br /> <br /> In the
      "Reminiscences" of Wordsworth, which the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge wrote
      for the late Bishop of Lincoln, in 1850, there is the following reference
      to <i>The Waggoner</i>. (See <i>Memoirs</i>, vol. ii. p. 310.)
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "<i>The Waggoner</i> seems a very favourite poem of his. He said his
        object in it had not been understood. It was a play of the fancy on a
        domestic incident, and lowly character. He wished by the opening
        descriptive lines to put his reader into the state of mind in which he
        wished it to be read. If he failed in doing that, he wished him to lay
        it down. He pointed out with the same view, the glowing lines on the
        state of exultation in which Ben and his companions are under the
        influence of liquor. Then he read the sickening languor of the morning
        walk, contrasted with the glorious uprising of Nature, and the songs of
        the birds. Here he has added about six most exquisite lines."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The lines referred to are doubtless the eight (p. 101), beginning
    </p>

      which were added in the edition of 1836.<br /> <br /> The following is Sara
      Coleridge's criticism of <i>The Waggoner</i>. (See <i>Biographia Literaria</i>,
      vol. ii. pp. 183, 184, edition 1847.)
    </p>

        "Due honour is done to 'Peter Bell', at this time, by students of poetry
        in general; but some, even of Mr. Wordsworth's greatest admirers, do not
        quite satisfy me in their admiration of 'The Waggoner', a poem which my
        dear uncle, Mr. Southey, preferred even to the former. 'Ich will meine
        Denkungs Art hierin niemandem aufdringen', as Lessing says: I will force
        my way of thinking on nobody, but take the liberty, for my own
        gratification, to express it. The sketches of hill and valley in this
        poem have a lightness, and spirit&mdash;an Allegro touch&mdash;distinguishing
        them from the grave and elevated splendour which characterises Mr.
        Wordsworth's representations of Nature in general, and from the passive
        tenderness of those in 'The White Doe', while it harmonises well with
        the human interest of the piece; indeed it is the harmonious sweetness
        of the composition which is most dwelt upon by its special admirers. In
        its course it describes, with bold brief touches, the striking mountain
        tract from Grasmere to Keswick; it commences with an evening storm among
        the mountains, presents a lively interior of a country inn during
        midnight, and concludes after bringing us in sight of St. John's Vale
        and the Vale of Keswick seen by day-break&mdash;'Skiddaw touched with
        rosy light,' and the prospect from Nathdale Fell 'hoar with the
        frost-like dews of dawn:' thus giving a beautiful and well-contrasted
        Panorama, produced by the most delicate and masterly strokes of the
        pencil. Well may Mr. Ruskin, a fine observer and eloquent describer of
        various classes of natural appearances, speak of Mr. Wordsworth as the
        great poetic landscape painter of the age. But Mr. Ruskin has found how
        seldom the great landscape painters are powerful in expressing human
        passions and affections on canvas, or even successful in the
        introduction of human figures into their foregrounds; whereas in the
        poetic paintings of Mr. Wordsworth the landscape is always subordinate
        to a higher interest; certainly, in 'The Waggoner', the little sketch of
        human nature which occupies, as it were, the front of that encircling
        background, the picture of Benjamin and his temptations, his humble
        friends and the mute companions of his way, has a character of its own,
        combining with sportiveness a homely pathos, which must ever be
        delightful to some of those who are thoroughly conversant with the
        spirit of Mr. Wordsworth's poetry. It may be compared with the ale-house
        scene in 'Tam o'Shanter', parts of Voss's Luise, or Ovid's Baucis and
        Philemon; though it differs from each of them as much as they differ
        from each other. The Epilogue carries on the feeling of the piece very
        beautifully."

      The editor of Southey's <i>Life and Correspondence</i>&mdash;his son, the
      Rev. Charles Cuthbert Southey&mdash;tells us, in a note to a letter from
      S.T. Coleridge to his father, that the Waggoner's name was Jackson; and
      that "all the circumstances of the poem are accurately correct." This
      Jackson, after retiring from active work as waggoner, became the tenant of
      Greta Hall, where first Coleridge, and afterwards Southey lived. The Hall
      was divided into two houses, one of which Jackson occupied, and the other
      of which he let to Coleridge, who speaks thus of him in the letter to
      Southey, dated Greta Hall, Keswick, April 13, 1801:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "My landlord, who dwells next door, has a very respectable library,
        which he has put with mine; histories, encyclopedias, and all the modern
        poetry, etc. etc. etc. A more truly disinterested man I never met with;
        severely frugal, yet almost carelessly generous; and yet he got all his
        money as a common carrier, by hard labour, and by pennies and pennies.
        He is one instance among many in this country of the salutary effect of
        the love of knowledge&mdash;he was from a boy a lover of learning."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      (See '<i>Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey,</i> vol. ii. pp. 147,
      148.)<br /> <br /> Charles Lamb&mdash;to whom <i>The Waggoner</i> was
      dedicated&mdash;wrote thus to Wordsworth on 7th June 1819:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "My dear Wordsworth,&mdash;You cannot imagine how proud we are here of
        the dedication. We read it twice for once that we do the poem. I mean
        all through; yet <i>Benjamin</i> is no common favourite; there is a
        spirit of beautiful tolerance in it. It is as good as it was in 1806;
        and it will be as good in 1829, if our dim eyes shall be awake to peruse
        it. Methinks there is a kind of shadowing affinity between the subject
        of the narrative and the subject of the dedication.<br /> ...<br /> "I do
        not know which I like best,&mdash;the prologue (the latter part
        especially) to <i>P. Bell,</i> or the epilogue to <i>Benjamin.</i> Yes,
        I tell stories; I do know I like the last best; and the <i>Waggoner</i>
        altogether is a pleasanter remembrance to me than the <i>Itinerant.</i><br />
        ...<br /> "<b>C. Lamb</b>."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      (See <i>The Letters of Charles Lamb,</i> edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. ii.
      pp. 24-26.)<br /> <br /> To this may be added what Southey wrote to Mr. Wade
      Browne on 15th June 1819:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I think you will be pleased with Wordsworth's <i>Waggoner</i>, if it
        were only for the line of road which it describes. The master of the
        waggon was my poor landlord Jackson, and the cause of his exchanging it
        for the one-horse cart was just as is represented in the poem; nobody
        but Benjamin could manage it upon these hills, and Benjamin could not
        resist the temptations by the wayside."

      an Autobiographical Poem
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Composed 1799-1805.&mdash;Published 1850

    <p>
      <br /> <a href="#24b1">The Poem</a><br /> <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <b><i>Advertisement</i></b><br /><br /> <br /> The following Poem
      was commenced in the beginning of the year 1799, and completed in the
      summer of 1805.<br /> <br /> The design and occasion of the work are
      described by the Author in his Preface to the <b><i>Excursion</i></b>,
      first published in 1814, where he thus speaks:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Several years ago, when the Author retired to his native mountains with
        the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might live,
        it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his own mind,
        and examine how far Nature and Education had qualified him for such an
        employment.<br /> <br /> "As subsidiary to this preparation, he undertook
        to record, in verse, the origin and progress of his own powers, as far
        as he was acquainted with them.<br /> <br /> "That work, addressed to a
        dear friend, most distinguished for his knowledge and genius, and to
        whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted, has been long finished;
        and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it, was a
        determination to compose a philosophical Poem, containing views of Man,
        Nature, and Society, and to be entitled 'The Recluse;' as having for its
        principal subject the sensations and opinions of a poet living in
        retirement.<br /> <br /> "The preparatory poem is biographical, and
        conducts the history of the Author's mind to the point when he was
        emboldened to hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for
        entering upon the arduous labour which he had proposed to himself; and
        the two works have the same kind of relation to each other, if he may so
        express himself, as the Ante-chapel has to the body of a Gothic Church.
        Continuing this allusion, he may be permitted to add, that his minor
        pieces, which have been long before the public, when they shall be
        properly arranged, will be found by the attentive reader to have such
        connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to
        the little cells, oratories, and sepulchral recesses, ordinarily
        included in those edifices."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Such was the Author's language in the year 1814.<br /> <br /> It will thence
      be seen, that the present Poem was intended to be introductory to the <b><i>Recluse</i></b>,
      and that the <b><i>Recluse</i></b>, if completed, would have consisted of
      Three Parts. Of these, the Second Part alone, viz. the <b><i>Excursion</i></b>,
      was finished, and given to the world by the Author.<br /> <br /> The First
      Book of the First Part of the<b> <i>Recluse</i></b> still remains in
      manuscript; but the Third Part was only planned. The materials of which it
      would have been formed have, however, been incorporated, for the most
      part, in the Author's other Publications, written subsequently to the <b><i>Excursion.</i></b><br />
      <br /> The Friend, to whom the present Poem is addressed, was the late <b>Samuel
      Taylor Coleridge</b>, who was resident in Malta, for the restoration of
      his health, when the greater part of it was composed.<br /> <br /> Mr.
      Coleridge read a considerable portion of the Poem while he was abroad; and
      his feelings, on hearing it recited by the Author (after his return to his
      own country) are recorded in his Verses, addressed to Mr. Wordsworth,
      which will be found in the <i>Sibylline Leaves,</i> p. 197, edition 1817,
      or <i>Poetical Works, by S. T. Coleridge,</i> vol. i. p. 206.<br /> <br />
      <b>Rydal Mount</b>, <i>July 13th</i>, 1850.<br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> This "advertisement" to the first edition of <i>The Prelude,</i>
      published in 1850&mdash;the year of Wordsworth's death&mdash;was written
      by Mr. Carter, who edited the volume. Mr. Carter was for many years the
      poet's secretary, and afterwards one of his literary executors. The poem
      was not only kept back from publication during Wordsworth's life-time, but
      it remained without a title; being alluded to by himself, when he spoke or
      wrote of it, as "the poem on my own poetical education," the "poem on my
      own life," etc.<br /> <br /> As <i>The Prelude</i> is autobiographical, a
      large part of Wordsworth's life might be written in the notes appended to
      it; but, besides breaking up the text of the poem unduly, this plan has
      many disadvantages, and would render a subsequent and detailed life of the
      poet either unnecessary or repetitive. The notes which follow will
      therefore be limited to the explanation of local, historical, and
      chronological allusions, or to references to Wordsworth's own career that
      are not obvious without them. It has been occasionally difficult to decide
      whether some of the allusions, to minute points in ancient history, medi&aelig;val
      mythology, and contemporary politics, should be explained or left alone;
      but I have preferred to err on the side of giving a brief clue to details,
      with which every scholar is familiar.<br /> <br /> <i>The Prelude</i> was
      begun as Wordsworth left the imperial city of Goslar, in Lower Saxony,
      where he spent part of the last winter of last century, and which he left
      on the 10th of February 1799. Only lines 1 to 45, however, were composed
      at that time; and the poem was continued at desultory intervals after the
      settlement at Grasmere, during 1800, and following years. Large portions
      of it were dictated to his devoted amanuenses as he walked, or sat, on the
      terraces of Lancrigg. Six books were finished by 1805.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The seventh was begun in the opening of that year; ... and the
        remaining seven were written before the end of June 1805, when his
        friend Coleridge was in the island of Malta, for the restoration of his
        health."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      (The late Bishop of Lincoln.)<br /> <br /> There is no uncertainty as to the
      year in which the later books were written; but there is considerable
      difficulty in fixing the precise date of the earlier ones. Writing from
      Grasmere to his friend Francis Wrangham&mdash;the letter is undated&mdash;Wordsworth
      says,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I am engaged in writing a poem on my own earlier life, which will take
        five parts or books to complete, three of which are nearly finished."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The late Bishop of Lincoln supposed that this letter to Wrangham was
      written "at the close of 1803, or beginning of 1804." (See <i>Memoirs of
      Wordsworth,</i> vol. i. p. 303.) There is evidence that it belongs to
      1804. At the commencement of the <a href="#24b7">seventh book</a>, p. 247,
      he says:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Six changeful years</i> have vanished since I first<br /> Poured out
        (saluted by that quickening breeze<br /> Which met me issuing from the
        City's walls)<br /> <i>A glad preamble to this Verse:</i> I sang<br />
        Aloud, with fervour irresistible<br /> Of short-lived transport, like a
        torrent bursting,<br /> From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side<br />
        To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth<br /> (So willed the Muse) <i>a
        less impetuous stream,<br /> That flowed awhile with unabating strength,<br />
        Then stopped for years; not audible again<br /> Before last
        primrose-time.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I have <i>italicised</i> the clauses which give some clue to the dates of
      composition. From these it would appear that the "glad preamble," written
      on leaving Goslar in 1799 (which, I think, included only the first two
      paragraphs of <a href="#24b1">book first</a>), was a "short-lived
      transport"; but that "soon" afterwards "a less impetuous stream" broke
      forth, which, after the settlement at Grasmere, "flowed awhile with
      unabating strength," and then "stopped for years." Now the above passage,
      recording these things, was written in 1805, and in the late autumn of
      that year; (as is evident from the reference which immediately follows to
      the "choir of redbreasts" and the approach of winter). We must therefore
      assign the flowing of the "less impetuous stream," to 1802; in order to
      leave room for the intervening "years," in which it ceased to flow, till
      it was audible again in the spring of 1804, "last primrose-time."<br />
      <br /> A second reference to date occurs in the <a href="#24b6">sixth book</a>,
      p. 224, entitled "Cambridge and the Alps," in which he says,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Four years and thirty, told, this very week,</i><br /> Have I been now
        a sojourner on earth.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This fixes definitely enough the date of the composition of <i>that</i>
      part of the work,<i> viz.</i> April 1804, which corresponds exactly to the
      "last primrose-time" of the previous extract from the <a href="#24b7">seventh
      book</a>, in which he tells us that after its long silence, his Muse was
      heard again. So far Wordsworth's own allusions to the date of <i>The
      Prelude.</i><br /> <br /> But there are others supplied by his own, and his
      sister's letters, and also by the <i>Grasmere Journal.</i> In the Dove
      Cottage household it was known, and talked of, as "the Poem to Coleridge;"
      and Dorothy records, on 11th January 1803, that her brother was working at
      it. On 13th February 1804, she writes to Mrs. Clarkson that her brother
      was engaged on a poem on his own life, and was "going on with great
      rapidity." On the 6th of March 1804, Wordsworth wrote from Grasmere to De
      Quincey,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "<a name="fr24A" id="fr24A"></a>I am now writing a poem on my own
        earlier life: I have just finished that part of it in which I speak of
        my residence at the University." ... It is "better than half complete,<i>
        viz.</i> four books, amounting to about 2500 lines."<a href="#24A"><sup>A</sup></a>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On the 24th of March, Dorothy wrote to Mrs. Clarkson, that since Coleridge
      left them (which was in January 1804), her brother had added 1500 lines to
      the poem on his own life. On the 29th of April 1804, Wordsworth wrote to
      Richard Sharpe,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I have been very busy these last ten weeks: having written between two
        and three thousand lines&mdash;accurately near three thousand&mdash;in
        that time; namely, four books, and a third of another. I am at present
        at the <a href="#24b7">Seventh Book</a>."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On the 25th December 1804, he wrote to Sir George Beaumont,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I have written upwards of 2000 verses during the last ten weeks."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      We thus find that Books <a href="#24b1">I.</a> to <a href="#24b4">IV.</a>
      had been written by the 6th of March 1804, that from the 19th February to
      the 29th of April nearly 3000 lines were written, that March and April
      were specially productive months, for by the 29th April he had reached <a
      href="#24b7">Book VII.</a> while from 16th October to 25th December he
      wrote over 2000 lines.<br /> <br /> Dorothy and Mary Wordsworth transcribed
      the earlier books more than once, and a copy of some of them was given to
      Coleridge to take with him to Malta.<br /> <br /> It is certain that the
      remaining books of <i>The Prelude</i> were all written in the spring and
      early summer of 1805; the <a href="#24b7">seventh</a>, <a href="#24b8">eighth</a>,
      <a href="#24b9">ninth</a>, <a href="#24b10">tenth</a>, <a href="#24b11">eleventh</a>,
      and part of the <a href="#24b12">twelfth</a> being finished about the
      middle of April; the last 300 lines of <a href="#24b12">book twelfth</a>
      in the last week of April; and the two remaining books&mdash;the <a
      href="#24b13">thirteenth</a> and <a href="#24b14">fourteenth&mdash;before</a>
      the 20th of May. The following extracts from letters of Wordsworth to Sir
      George Beaumont make this clear, and also cast light on matters much more
      important than the mere dates of composition.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Grasmere</b>, Dec. 25, 1804.<br /> <br /> "My dear Sir George,&mdash;You
        will be pleased to hear that I have been advancing with my work: I have
        written upwards of 2000 verses during the last ten weeks. I do not know
        if you are exactly acquainted with the plan of my poetical labour: It is
        twofold; first, a Poem, to be called <i>The Recluse;</i> in which it
        will be my object to express in verse my most interesting feelings
        concerning man, nature, and society; and next, a poem (in which I am at
        present chiefly engaged) on <i>my earlier life, or the growth of my own
        mind,</i> taken up upon a large scale. This latter work I expect to have
        finished before the month of May; and then I purpose to fall with all my
        might on the former, which is the chief object upon which my thoughts
        have been fixed these many years. Of this poem, that of <i>The Pedlar,</i>
        which Coleridge read to you, is part; and I may have written of it
        altogether about 2000 lines. It will consist, I hope, of about ten or
        twelve thousand."<br /> <br />

        I turned my thoughts again to the <i>Poem on my own Life</i>, and you
        will be glad to hear that I have added 300 lines to it in the course of
        last week. Two books more will conclude it. It will not be much less
        than 9000 lines,&mdash;not hundred but thousand lines long,&mdash;an
        alarming length! and a thing unprecedented in literary history that a
        man should talk so much about himself. It is not self-conceit, as you
        will know well, that has induced me to do this, but real humility. I
        began the work because I was <i>unprepared</i> to treat <i>any more
        arduous subject</i>, and <i>diffident of my own powers</i>. Here, at
        least, I hoped that to a certain degree I should be sure of succeeding,
        as I had nothing to do but describe what I had felt and thought, and
        therefore could not easily be bewildered. This might have been done in
        narrower compass by a man of more address; but I have done my best. If,
        when the work shall be finished, it appears to the judicious to have
        redundancies, they shall be lopped off, if possible; but this is very
        difficult to do, when a man has written with thought; and this defect,
        whenever I have suspected it or found it to exist in any writings of
        mine, I have always found it incurable. The fault lies too deep, and is
        in the first conception."<br /> <br />

        <br /> <br /> <b>Grasmere</b>, June 3, 1805.<br /> <br /> "I have the
        pleasure to say that I <i>finished my poem</i> about a fortnight ago. I
        had looked forward to the day as a most happy one; ... But it was not a
        happy day for me; I was dejected on many accounts: when I looked back
        upon the performance, it seemed to have a dead weight about it,&mdash;the
        reality so far short of the expectation. It was the first long labour
        that I had finished; and the doubt whether I should ever live to write
        <i>The Recluse</i>, and the sense which I had of this poem being so far
        below what I seemed capable of executing, depressed me much; above all,
        many heavy thoughts of my poor departed brother hung upon me, the joy
        which I should have had in showing him the manuscript, and a thousand
        other vain fancies and dreams. I have spoken of this, because it was a
        state of feeling new to me, the occasion being new. This work may be
        considered as a sort of <i>portico</i> to <i>The Recluse</i>, part of
        the same building, which I hope to be able, ere long, to begin with in
        earnest; and if I am permitted to bring it to a conclusion, and to
        write, further, a narrative poem of the epic kind, I shall consider the
        task of my life as over. I ought to add, that I have the satisfaction of
        finding the present poem not quite of so alarming a length as I
        apprehended."

      These letters explain the delay in the publication of <i>The Prelude</i>.
      They show that what led Wordsworth to write so much about himself was not
      self-conceit, but self-diffidence. He felt unprepared as yet for the more
      arduous task he had set before himself. He saw its faults as clearly, or
      more clearly, than the critics who condemned him. He knew that its length
      was excessive. He tried to condense it; he kept it beside him unpublished,
      and occasionally revised it, with a view to condensation, in vain. The
      text received his final corrections in the year 1832.<br /> <br />
      Wordsworth's reluctance to publish these portions of his great poem, <i>The
      Recluse</i>, other than <i>The Excursion</i>, during his lifetime, was a
      matter of surprise to his friends; to whom he, or the ladies of his
      household, had read portions of it. In the year 1819, Charles Lamb wrote
      to him,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "If, as you say, <i>The Waggoner</i>, in some sort, came at my call, oh
        for a potent voice to call forth <i>The Recluse</i> from his profound
        dormitory, where he sleeps forgetful of his foolish charge&mdash;the
        world!"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      (<i>The Letters of Charles Lamb</i>, edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. ii. p.
      26.)<br /> <br /> The admission made in the letter of May 1st, 1805, is
      note-worthy:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "This defect" (of redundancy) "whenever I have suspected it or found it
        to exist in any writings of mine, <i>I have always found incurable. The
        fault lies too deep, and is in the first conception</i>."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The actual result&mdash;in the Poem he had at length committed to writing&mdash;was
      so far inferior to the ideal he had tried to realise, that he could never
      be induced to publish it. He spoke of the MS. as forming a sort of <i>portico</i>
      to his larger work&mdash;the poem on Man, Nature, and Society&mdash;which
      he meant to call <i>The Recluse</i>, and of which one portion only, <i>viz.
      The Excursion</i>, was finished. It is clear that throughout the
      composition of <i>The Prelude</i>, he felt that he was experimenting with
      his powers. He wished to find out whether he could construct "a literary
      work that might live," on a larger scale than his Lyrics; and it was on
      the writing of a "philosophical poem," dealing with Man and Nature, in
      their deepest aspects, that his thoughts had been fixed for many years.
      From the letter to Sir George Beaumont, December 25, 1804, it is evident
      that he regarded the autobiographical poem as a mere prologue to this
      larger work, to which he hoped to turn "with all his might" after <i>The
      Prelude</i> was finished, and of which he had already written about a
      fifth or a sixth (see <i>Memoirs</i>, vol. i. p. 304). This was the part
      known in the Grasmere household as "The Pedlar," a title given to it from
      the character of the Wanderer, but afterwards happily set aside. He did
      not devote himself, however, to the completion of his wider purpose,
      immediately after <i>The Prelude</i> was finished. He wrote one book of <i>The
      Recluse</i> which he called "Home at Grasmere"; and, though detached from
      <i>The Prelude</i>, it is a continuation of the narrative of his own life
      at the point where it is left off in the latter poem. It consists of 733
      lines. Two extracts from it were published in the <i>Memoirs of Wordsworth</i>
      in 1851 (vol. i. pp. 151 and 155), beginning [Volume 2 links:],
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <a href="#section26"> 'On Nature's invitation do I come,'</a>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      and
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <a href="#section27">'Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak.'</a>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      These will be found in vol. ii. of this edition, pp. 118 and 121
      respectively.<br /> <br /> The autobiographical poem remained, as already
      stated, during Wordsworth's lifetime without a title. The name finally
      adopted&mdash;<i>The Prelude</i>&mdash;was suggested by Mrs. Wordsworth,
      both to indicate its relation to the larger work, and the fact of its
      having been written comparatively early.<br /> <br /> As the poem was
      addressed to Coleridge, it may be desirable to add in this place his
      critical verdict upon it; along with the poem which he wrote, on hearing
      Wordsworth read a portion of it to him, in the winter of 1806, at
      Coleorton.<br /> <br /> In his <i>Table Talk</i> (London, 1835, vol. ii. p.
      70), Coleridge's opinion is recorded thus:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I cannot help regretting that Wordsworth did not first publish his
        thirteen (fourteen) books on the growth of an individual mind&mdash;superior,
        as I used to think, upon the whole to <i>The Excursion</i>. You may
        judge how I felt about them by my own Poem upon the occasion. Then the
        plan laid out, and, I believe, partly suggested by me, was, that
        Wordsworth should assume the station of a man in mental repose, one
        whose principles were made up, and so prepared to deliver upon authority
        a system of philosophy. He was to treat man as man,&mdash;a subject of
        eye, ear, touch, and taste in contact with external nature, and
        informing the senses from the mind, and not compounding a mind out of
        the senses; then he was to describe the pastoral and other states of
        society, assuming something of the Juvenalian spirit as he approached
        the high civilisation of cities and towns, and opening a melancholy
        picture of the present state of degeneracy and vice; thence he was to
        infer and reveal the proof of, and necessity for, the whole state of man
        and society being subject to, and illustrative of a redemptive process
        in operation, showing how this idea reconciled all the anomalies, and
        promised future glory and restoration. Something of this sort was, I
        think, agreed on. It is, in substance, what I have been all my life
        doing in my system of philosophy.<br /> <br /> "I think Wordsworth
        possessed more of the genius of a great Philosopher than any man I ever
        knew, or, as I believe, has existed in England since Milton; but it
        seems to me that he ought never to have abandoned the contemplative
        position which is peculiarly&mdash;perhaps, I might say exclusively&mdash;fitted
        for him. His proper title is <i>Spectator ab extra</i>."

        and the building up<br /> Of a Human Spirit thou hast dared to tell<br />
        What may be told, to the understanding mind<br /> Revealable; and what

        first-born they of Reason and twin-birth),<br /> Of tides obedient to
        external force,<br /> And currents self-determined, as might seem,<br />
        Or by some inner power; of moments awful,<br /> Now in thy inner life,

        Social Sense<br /> Distending wide, and man beloved as man,<br /> Where
        France in all her towns lay vibrating<br /> Like some becalmed bark
        beneath the burst<br /> Of Heaven's immediate thunder, when no cloud<br />
        Is visible, or shadow on the main.<br /> For thou wert there, thine own
        brows garlanded,<br /> Amid the tremor of a realm aglow,<br /> Amid a
        mighty nation jubilant,<br /> When from the general heart of humankind<br />
        Hope sprang forth like a full-born Deity!<br /> &mdash;Of that dear Hope
        afflicted and struck down,<br /> So summoned homeward, thenceforth calm
        and sure,<br /> From the dread watch-tower of man's absolute self,<br />
        With light unwaning on her eyes, to look<br /> Far on&mdash;herself a
        glory to behold.<br /> The Angel of the vision! Then (last strain)<br />

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O great Bard!<br /> Ere yet that last strain dying

        pulses of my being beat anew:<br /> And even as life returns upon the
        drowned,<br /> Life's joy rekindling roused a throng of pains&mdash;<br />
        Keen pangs of Love, awakening as a babe<br /> Turbulent, with an outcry
        in the heart;<br /> And fears self-willed, that shunned the eye of hope;<br />
        And hope that scarce would know itself from fear;<br /> Sense of past
        youth, and manhood come in vain,<br /> And genius given, and knowledge
        won in vain;<br /> And all which I had culled in wood-walks wild,<br />
        And all which patient toil had reared, and all,<br /> Commune with thee

        upon my bier,<br /> In the same coffin, for the self-same grave!<br /><br />
        ... Eve following eve,<br /> Dear tranquil time, when the sweet sense of
        Home<br /> Is sweetest! moments for their own sake hailed,<br /> And more
        desired, more precious for thy song,<br /> In silence listening, like a
        devout child,<br /> My soul lay passive, by thy various strain<br />
        Driven as in surges now beneath the stars,<br /> With momentary stars of
        my own birth,<br /> Fair constellated foam, [C] still darting off<br />

          O there is blessing in this gentle breeze,<br /> A visitant that while
          it fans my cheek<br /> Doth seem half-conscious of the joy it brings<br />
          From the green fields, and from yon azure sky.<br /> Whate'er its
          mission, the soft breeze can come<br /> To none more grateful than to
          me; escaped<br /> From the vast city, where I long had pined<br /> A
          discontented sojourner: now free,<br /> Free as a bird to settle where
          I will.<br /> What dwelling shall receive me? in what vale<br /> Shall
          be my harbour? underneath what grove<br /> Shall I take up my home? and
          what clear stream<br /> Shall with its murmur lull me into rest?<br />
          The earth is all before me. With a heart<br /> Joyous, nor scared at
          its own liberty,<br /> I look about; and should the chosen guide<br />
          Be nothing better than a wandering cloud,<br /> I cannot miss my way. I
          breathe again!<br /> Trances of thought and mountings of the mind<br />
          Come fast upon me: it is shaken off,<br /> That burthen of my own
          unnatural self,<br /> The heavy weight of many a weary day<br /> Not
          mine, and such as were not made for me.<br /> Long months of peace (if
          such bold word accord<br /> With any promises of human life),<br /> Long
          months of ease and undisturbed delight<br /> Are mine in prospect;
          whither shall I turn,<br /> By road or pathway, or through trackless
          field,<br /> Up hill or down, or shall some floating thing<br /> Upon
          the river point me out my course?<br /><br /> Dear Liberty! Yet what
          would it avail<br /> But for a gift that consecrates the joy?<br /> For
          I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven<br /> Was blowing on my
          body, felt within<br /> A correspondent breeze, that gently moved<br />
          With quickening virtue, but is now become<br /> A tempest, a redundant
          energy,<br /> Vexing its own creation. Thanks to both,<br /> And their
          congenial powers, that, while they join<br /> In breaking up a
          long-continued frost,<br /> Bring with them vernal promises, the hope<br />
          Of active days urged on by flying hours,&mdash;<br /> Days of sweet
          leisure, taxed with patient thought<br /> Abstruse, nor wanting
          punctual service high,<br /> Matins and vespers of harmonious verse!<br /><br />
          Thus far, O Friend! did I, not used to make<br /> A present joy the
          matter of a song,<br /> Pour forth that day my soul in measured strains<br />
          That would not be forgotten, and are here<br /> Recorded: to the open
          fields I told<br /> A prophecy: poetic numbers came<br /> Spontaneously
          to clothe in priestly robe<br /> A renovated spirit singled out,<br />
          Such hope was mine, for holy services.<br /> My own voice cheered me,
          and, far more, the mind's<br /> Internal echo of the imperfect sound;<br />
          To both I listened, drawing from them both<br /> A cheerful confidence
          in things to come.<br /><br /> Content and not unwilling now to give<br />
          A respite to this passion, I paced on<br /> With brisk and eager steps;
          and came, at length,<br /> To a green shady place, where down I sate<br />
          Beneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice,<br /> And settling
          into gentler happiness.<br /> 'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day,<br />
          With warmth, as much as needed, from a sun<br /> Two hours declined
          towards the west; a day<br /> With silver clouds, and sunshine on the
          grass,<br /> And in the sheltered and the sheltering grove<br /> A
          perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts<br /> Encouraged and
          dismissed, till choice was made<br /> Of a known Vale, whither my feet
          should turn,<br /> Nor rest till they had reached the very door<br /> Of
          the one cottage which methought I saw.<br /> No picture of mere memory
          ever looked<br /> So fair; and while upon the fancied scene<br /> I
          gazed with growing love, a higher power<br /> Than Fancy gave assurance
          of some work<br /> Of glory there forthwith to be begun,<br /> Perhaps
          too there performed. Thus long I mused,<br /> Nor e'er lost sight of
          what I mused upon,<br /> Save when, amid the stately groves of oaks,<br />
          Now here, now there, an acorn, from its cup<br /> Dislodged, through
          sere leaves rustled, or at once<br /> To the bare earth dropped with a
          startling sound.<br /> From that soft couch I rose not, till the sun<br />
          Had almost touched the horizon; casting then<br /> A backward glance
          upon the curling cloud<br /> Of city smoke, by distance ruralised;<br />
          Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive,<br /> But as a Pilgrim resolute, I
          took,<br /> Even with the chance equipment of that hour,<br /> The road
          that pointed toward the chosen Vale.<br /> It was a splendid evening,
          and my soul<br /> Once more made trial of her strength, nor lacked<br />
          &AElig;olian visitations; but the harp<br /> Was soon defrauded, and
          the banded host<br /> Of harmony dispersed in straggling sounds,<br />
          And lastly utter silence! "Be it so;<br /> Why think of any thing but
          present good?"<br /> So, like a home-bound labourer I pursued<br /> My
          way beneath the mellowing sun, that shed<br /> Mild influence; nor left
          in me one wish<br /> Again to bend the Sabbath of that time<br /> To a
          servile yoke. What need of many words?<br /> A pleasant loitering
          journey, through three days<br /> Continued, brought me to my
          hermitage,<br /> I spare to tell of what ensued, the life<br /> In
          common things&mdash;the endless store of things,<br /> Rare, or at
          least so seeming, every day<br /> Found all about me in one
          neighbourhood&mdash;<br /> The self-congratulation, and, from morn<br />
          To night, unbroken cheerfulness serene.<br /> But speedily an earnest
          longing rose<br /> To brace myself to some determined aim,<br /> Reading
          or thinking; either to lay up<br /> New stores, or rescue from decay
          the old<br /> By timely interference: and therewith<br /> Came hopes
          still higher, that with outward life<br /> I might endue some airy
          phantasies<br /> That had been floating loose about for years,<br /> And
          to such beings temperately deal forth<br /> The many feelings that
          oppressed my heart.<br /> That hope hath been discouraged; welcome
          light<br /> Dawns from the east, but dawns to disappear<br /> And mock
          me with a sky that ripens not<br /> Into a steady morning: if my mind,<br />
          Remembering the bold promise of the past,<br /> Would gladly grapple
          with some noble theme,<br /> Vain is her wish; where'er she turns she
          finds<br /> Impediments from day to day renewed.<br /><br /> And now it
          would content me to yield up<br /> Those lofty hopes awhile, for
          present gifts<br /> Of humbler industry. But, oh, dear Friend!<br /> The
          Poet, gentle creature as he is,<br /> Hath, like the Lover, his unruly
          times;<br /> His fits when he is neither sick nor well,<br /> Though no
          distress be near him but his own<br /> Unmanageable thoughts: his mind,
          best pleased<br /> While she as duteous as the mother dove<br /> Sits
          brooding, lives not always to that end,<br /> But like the innocent
          bird, hath goadings on<br /> That drive her as in trouble through the
          groves;<br /> With me is now such passion, to be blamed<br /> No
          otherwise than as it lasts too long.<br /><br /> When, as becomes a man
          who would prepare<br /> For such an arduous work, I through myself<br />
          Make rigorous inquisition, the report<br /> Is often cheering; for I
          neither seem<br /> To lack that first great gift, the vital soul,<br />
          Nor general Truths, which are themselves a sort<br /> Of Elements and
          Agents, Under-powers,<br /> Subordinate helpers of the living mind:<br />
          Nor am I naked of external things,<br /> Forms, images, nor numerous
          other aids<br /> Of less regard, though won perhaps with toil<br /> And
          needful to build up a Poet's praise.<br /> Time, place, and manners do
          I seek, and these<br /> Are found in plenteous store, but nowhere such<br />
          As may be singled out with steady choice;<br /> No little band of yet
          remembered names<br /> Whom I, in perfect confidence, might hope<br />
          To summon back from lonesome banishment,<br /> And make them dwellers
          in the hearts of men<br /> Now living, or to live in future years.<br />
          Sometimes the ambitious Power of choice, mistaking<br /> Proud
          spring-tide swellings for a regular sea,<br /> Will settle on some
          British theme, some old<br /> Romantic tale by Milton left unsung;<br />
          More often turning to some gentle place<br /> Within the groves of
          Chivalry, I pipe<br /> To shepherd swains, or seated harp in hand,<br />
          Amid reposing knights by a river side<br /> Or fountain, listen to the
          grave reports<br /> Of dire enchantments faced and overcome<br /> By the
          strong mind, and tales of warlike feats,<br /> Where spear encountered
          spear, and sword with sword<br /> Fought, as if conscious of the
          blazonry<br /> That the shield bore, so glorious was the strife;<br />
          Whence inspiration for a song that winds<br /> Through ever changing
          scenes of votive quest<br /> Wrongs to redress, harmonious tribute paid<br />
          To patient courage and unblemished truth,<br /> To firm devotion, zeal
          unquenchable,<br /> And Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves.<br />
          Sometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate<br /> How vanquished
          Mithridates northward passed,<br /> And, hidden in the cloud of years,
          became<br /> Odin, the Father of a race by whom<br /> Perished the Roman
          Empire: how the friends<br /> And followers of Sertorius, out of Spain<br />
          Flying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles,<br /> And left their
          usages, their arts and laws,<br /> To disappear by a slow gradual
          death,<br /> To dwindle and to perish one by one,<br /> Starved in those
          narrow bounds: but not the soul<br /> Of Liberty, which fifteen hundred
          years<br /> Survived, and, when the European came<br /> With skill and
          power that might not be withstood,<br /> Did, like a pestilence,
          maintain its hold<br /> And wasted down by glorious death that race<br />
          Of natural heroes: or I would record<br /> How, in tyrannic times, some
          high-souled man,<br /> Unnamed among the chronicles of kings,<br />
          Suffered in silence for Truth's sake: or tell,<br /> How that one
          Frenchman, through continued force<br /> Of meditation on the inhuman
          deeds<br /> Of those who conquered first the Indian Isles,<br /> Went
          single in his ministry across<br /> The Ocean; not to comfort the
          oppressed,<br /> But, like a thirsty wind, to roam about<br /> Withering
          the Oppressor: how Gustavus sought<br /> Help at his need in
          Dalecarlia's mines:<br /> How Wallace fought for Scotland; left the
          name<br /> Of Wallace to be found, like a wild flower,<br /> All over
          his dear Country; left the deeds<br /> Of Wallace, like a family of
          Ghosts,<br /> To people the steep rocks and river banks,<br /> Her
          natural sanctuaries, with a local soul<br /> Of independence and stern
          liberty.<br /> Sometimes it suits me better to invent<br /> A tale from
          my own heart, more near akin<br /> To my own passions and habitual
          thoughts;<br /> Some variegated story, in the main<br /> Lofty, but the
          unsubstantial structure melts<br /> Before the very sun that brightens
          it,<br /> Mist into air dissolving! Then a wish,<br /> My best and
          favourite aspiration, mounts<br /> With yearning toward some
          philosophic song<br /> Of Truth that cherishes our daily life;<br />
          With meditations passionate from deep<br /> Recesses in man's heart,
          immortal verse<br /> Thoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre;<br /> But
          from this awful burthen I full soon<br /> Take refuge and beguile
          myself with trust<br /> That mellower years will bring a riper mind<br />
          And clearer insight. Thus my days are past<br /> In contradiction; with
          no skill to part<br /> Vague longing, haply bred by want of power,<br />
          From paramount impulse not to be withstood,<br /> A timorous capacity
          from prudence,<br /> From circumspection, infinite delay.<br /> Humility
          and modest awe themselves<br /> Betray me, serving often for a cloak<br />
          To a more subtle selfishness; that now<br /> Locks every function up in
          blank reserve,<br /> Now dupes me, trusting to an anxious eye<br /> That
          with intrusive restlessness beats off<br /> Simplicity and
          self-presented truth.<br /> Ah! better far than this, to stray about<br />
          Voluptuously through fields and rural walks,<br /> And ask no record of
          the hours, resigned<br /> To vacant musing, unreproved neglect<br /> Of
          all things, and deliberate holiday.<br /> Far better never to have
          heard the name<br /> Of zeal and just ambition, than to live<br />
          Baffled and plagued by a mind that every hour<br /> Turns recreant to
          her task; takes heart again,<br /> Then feels immediately some hollow
          thought<br /> Hang like an interdict upon her hopes.<br /> This is my
          lot; for either still I find<br /> Some imperfection in the chosen
          theme,<br /> Or see of absolute accomplishment<br /> Much wanting, so
          much wanting, in myself,<br /> That I recoil and droop, and seek repose<br />
          In listlessness from vain perplexity,<br /> Unprofitably travelling
          toward the grave,<br /> Like a false steward who hath much received<br />
          And renders nothing back.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it for this<br /> That one,
          the fairest of all rivers, loved<br /> To blend his murmurs with my
          nurse's song,<br /> And, from his alder shades and rocky falls,<br />
          And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice<br /> That flowed along
          my dreams? For this, didst thou,<br /> O Derwent! winding among grassy
          holms<br /> Where I was looking on, a babe in arms,<br /> Make ceaseless
          music that composed my thoughts<br /> To more than infant softness,
          giving me<br /> Amid the fretful dwellings of mankind<br /> A foretaste,
          a dim earnest, of the calm<br /> That Nature breathes among the hills
          and groves?<br /> When he had left the mountains and received<br /> On
          his smooth breast the shadow of those towers<br /> That yet survive, a
          shattered monument<br /> Of feudal sway, the bright blue river passed<br />
          Along the margin of our terrace walk;<br /> A tempting playmate whom we
          dearly loved.<br /> Oh, many a time have I, a five years' child,<br />
          In a small mill-race severed from his stream,<br /> Made one long
          bathing of a summer's day;<br /> Basked in the sun, and plunged and
          basked again<br /> Alternate, all a summer's day, or scoured<br /> The
          sandy fields, leaping through flowery groves<br /> Of yellow ragwort;
          or when rock and hill,<br /> The woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty
          height,<br /> Were bronzed with deepest radiance, stood alone<br />
          Beneath the sky, as if I had been born<br /> On Indian plains, and from
          my mother's hut<br /> Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport<br /> A
          naked savage, in the thunder shower.<br /><br /> Fair seed-time had my
          soul, and I grew up<br /> Fostered alike by beauty and by fear:<br />
          Much favoured in my birth-place, and no less<br /> In that beloved Vale
          to which erelong<br /> We were transplanted&mdash;there were we let
          loose<br /> For sports of wider range. Ere I had told<br /> Ten
          birth-days, when among the mountain slopes<br /> Frost, and the breath
          of frosty wind, had snapped<br /> The last autumnal crocus, 'twas my
          joy<br /> With store of springes o'er my shoulder hung<br /> To range
          the open heights where woodcocks run<br /> Along the smooth green turf.
          Through half the night,<br /> Scudding away from snare to snare, I
          plied<br /> That anxious visitation;&mdash;moon and stars<br /> Were
          shining o'er my head. I was alone,<br /> And seemed to be a trouble to
          the peace<br /> That dwelt among them. Sometimes it befel<br /> In these
          night wanderings, that a strong desire<br /> O'erpowered my better
          reason, and the bird<br /> Which was the captive of another's toil<br />
          Became my prey; and when the deed was done<br /> I heard among the
          solitary hills<br /> Low breathings coming after me, and sounds<br /> Of
          undistinguishable motion, steps<br /> Almost as silent as the turf they
          trod.<br /><br /> Nor less when spring had warmed the cultured Vale,<br />
          Moved we as plunderers where the mother-bird<br /> Had in high places
          built her lodge; though mean<br /> Our object and inglorious, yet the
          end<br /> Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung<br /> Above the raven's
          nest, by knots of grass<br /> And half-inch fissures in the slippery
          rock<br /> But ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)<br /> Suspended
          by the blast that blew amain,<br /> Shouldering the naked crag, oh, at
          that time<br /> While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,<br /> With
          what strange utterance did the loud dry wind<br /> Blow through my ear!
          the sky seemed not a sky<br /> Of earth&mdash;and with what motion
          moved the clouds!<br /><br /> Dust as we are, the immortal spirit grows<br />
          Like harmony in music; there is a dark<br /> Inscrutable workmanship
          that reconciles<br /> Discordant elements, makes them cling together<br />
          In one society. How strange that all<br /> The terrors, pains, and
          early miseries,<br /> Regrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused<br />
          Within my mind, should e'er have borne a part,<br /> And that a needful
          part, in making up<br /> The calm existence that is mine when I<br /> Am
          worthy of myself! Praise to the end!<br /> Thanks to the means which
          Nature deigned to employ;<br /> Whether her fearless visitings, or
          those<br /> That came with soft alarm, like hurtless light<br /> Opening
          the peaceful clouds; or she may use<br /> Severer interventions,
          ministry<br /> More palpable, as best might suit her aim.<br /><br /> One
          summer evening (led by her) I found<br /> A little boat tied to a
          willow tree<br /> Within a rocky cave, its usual home.<br /> Straight I
          unloosed her chain, and stepping in<br /> Pushed from the shore. It was
          an act of stealth<br /> And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice<br />
          Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;<br /> Leaving behind her still,
          on either side,<br /> Small circles glittering idly in the moon,<br />
          Until they melted all into one track<br /> Of sparkling light. But now,
          like one who rows,<br /> Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point<br />
          With an unswerving line, I fixed my view<br /> Upon the summit of a
          craggy ridge,<br /> The horizon's utmost boundary; far above<br /> Was
          nothing but the stars and the grey sky.<br /> She was an elfin pinnace;
          lustily<br /> I dipped my oars into the silent lake,<br /> And, as I
          rose upon the stroke, my boat<br /> Went heaving through the water like
          a swan;<br /> When, from behind that craggy steep till then<br /> The
          horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,<br /> As if with
          voluntary power instinct<br /> Upreared its head. I struck and struck
          again,<br /> And growing still in stature the grim shape<br /> Towered
          up between me and the stars, and still,<br /> For so it seemed, with
          purpose of its own<br /> And measured motion like a living thing,<br />
          Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,<br /> And through the
          silent water stole my way<br /> Back to the covert of the willow tree;<br />
          There in her mooring-place I left my bark,&mdash;<br /> And through the
          meadows homeward went, in grave<br /> And serious mood; but after I had
          seen<br /> That spectacle, for many days, my brain<br /> Worked with a
          dim and undetermined sense<br /> Of unknown modes of being; o'er my
          thoughts<br /> There hung a darkness, call it solitude<br /> Or blank
          desertion. No familiar shapes<br /> Remained, no pleasant images of
          trees,<br /> Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;<br /> But huge
          and mighty forms, that do not live<br /> Like living men, moved slowly
          through the mind<br /> By day, and were a trouble to my dreams.<br /><br />
          Wisdom and Spirit of the universe!<br /> Thou Soul that art the
          eternity of thought,<br /> That givest to forms and images a breath<br />
          And everlasting motion, not in vain<br /> By day or star-light thus
          from my first dawn<br /> Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me<br />
          The passions that build up our human soul;<br /> Not with the mean and
          vulgar works of man,<br /> But with high objects, with enduring things&mdash;<br />
          With life and nature, purifying thus<br /> The elements of feeling and
          of thought,<br /> And sanctifying, by such discipline,<br /> Both pain
          and fear, until we recognise<br /> A grandeur in the beatings of the
          heart.<br /> Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me<br /> With stinted
          kindness. In November days,<br /> When vapours rolling down the valley
          made<br /> A lonely scene more lonesome, among woods<br /> At noon, and
          'mid the calm of summer nights,<br /> When, by the margin of the
          trembling lake,<br /> Beneath the gloomy hills homeward I went<br /> In
          solitude, such intercourse was mine;<br /> Mine was it in the fields
          both day and night,<br /> And by the waters, all the summer long.<br /><br />
          And in the frosty season, when the sun<br /> Was set, and visible for
          many a mile<br /> The cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom,<br />
          I heeded not their summons: happy time<br /> It was indeed for all of
          us&mdash;for me<br /> It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud<br /> The
          village clock tolled six,&mdash;I wheeled about,<br /> Proud and
          exulting like an untired horse<br /> That cares not for his home. All
          shod with steel,<br /> We hissed along the polished ice in games<br />
          Confederate, imitative of the chase<br /> And woodland pleasures,&mdash;the
          resounding horn,<br /> The pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare.<br />
          So through the darkness and the cold we flew,<br /> And not a voice was
          idle; with the din<br /> Smitten, the precipices rang aloud;<br /> The
          leafless trees and every icy crag<br /> Tinkled like iron; while far
          distant hills<br /> Into the tumult sent an alien sound<br /> Of
          melancholy not unnoticed, while the stars<br /> Eastward were sparkling
          clear, and in the west<br /> The orange sky of evening died away.<br />
          Not seldom from the uproar I retired<br /> Into a silent bay, or
          sportively<br /> Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,<br />
          To cut across the reflex of a star<br /> That fled, and, flying still
          before me, gleamed<br /> Upon the glassy plain; and oftentimes,<br />
          When we had given our bodies to the wind,<br /> And all the shadowy
          banks on either side<br /> Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning
          still<br /> The rapid line of motion, then at once<br /> Have I,
          reclining back upon my heels,<br /> Stopped short; yet still the
          solitary cliffs<br /> Wheeled by me&mdash;even as if the earth had
          rolled<br /> With visible motion her diurnal round!<br /> Behind me did
          they stretch in solemn train,<br /> Feebler and feebler, and I stood
          and watched<br /> Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.<br /><br />
          Ye Presences of Nature in the sky<br /> And on the earth! Ye Visions of
          the hills!<br /> And Souls of lonely places! can I think<br /> A vulgar
          hope was yours when ye employed<br /> Such ministry, when ye through
          many a year<br /> Haunting me thus among my boyish sports,<br /> On
          caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,<br /> Impressed upon all
          forms the characters<br /> Of danger or desire; and thus did make<br />
          The surface of the universal earth<br /> With triumph and delight, with
          hope and fear,<br /> Work like a sea?<br /> Not uselessly employed,<br />
          Might I pursue this theme through every change<br /> Of exercise and
          play, to which the year<br /> Did summon us in his delightful round.<br /><br />
          We were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven<br /> Beheld not vales more
          beautiful than ours;<br /> Nor saw a band in happiness and joy<br />
          Richer, or worthier of the ground they trod.<br /> I could record with
          no reluctant voice<br /> The woods of autumn, and their hazel bowers<br />
          With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,<br /> True symbol of
          hope's foolishness, whose strong<br /> And unreproved enchantment led
          us on<br /> By rocks and pools shut out from every star,<br /> All the
          green summer, to forlorn cascades<br /> Among the windings hid of
          mountain brooks.<br /> &mdash;Unfading recollections! at this hour<br />
          The heart is almost mine with which I felt,<br /> From some hill-top on
          sunny afternoons,<br /> The paper kite high among fleecy clouds<br />
          Pull at her rein like an impetuous courser;<br /> Or, from the meadows
          sent on gusty days,<br /> Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly<br />
          Dashed headlong, and rejected by the storm.<br /><br /> Ye lowly
          cottages wherein we dwelt,<br /> A ministration of your own was yours;<br />
          Can I forget you, being as you were<br /> So beautiful among the
          pleasant fields<br /> In which ye stood? or can I here forget<br /> The
          plain and seemly countenance with which<br /> Ye dealt out your plain
          comforts? Yet had ye<br /> Delights and exultations of your own.<br />
          Eager and never weary we pursued<br /> Our home-amusements by the warm
          peat-fire<br /> At evening, when with pencil, and smooth slate<br /> In
          square divisions parcelled out and all<br /> With crosses and with
          cyphers scribbled o'er,<br /> We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to
          head<br /> In strife too humble to be named in verse:<br /> Or round the
          naked table, snow-white deal,<br /> Cherry or maple, sate in close
          array,<br /> And to the combat, Loo or Whist, led on<br /> A
          thick-ribbed army; not, as in the world,<br /> Neglected and
          ungratefully thrown by<br /> Even for the very service they had
          wrought,<br /> But husbanded through many a long campaign.<br /> Uncouth
          assemblage was it, where no few<br /> Had changed their functions;
          some, plebeian cards[l]<br /> Which Fate, beyond the promise of their
          birth,<br /> Had dignified, and called to represent<br /> The persons of
          departed potentates.<br /> Oh, with what echoes on the board they fell!<br />
          Ironic diamonds,&mdash;clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades,<br /> A
          congregation piteously akin!<br /> Cheap matter offered they to boyish
          wit,<br /> Those sooty knaves, precipitated down<br /> With scoffs and
          taunts, like Vulcan out of heaven:<br /> The paramount ace, a moon in
          her eclipse,<br /> Queens gleaming through their splendour's last
          decay,<br /> And monarchs surly at the wrongs sustained<br /> By royal
          visages. Meanwhile abroad<br /> Incessant rain was falling, or the
          frost<br /> Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth;<br /> And,
          interrupting oft that eager game,<br /> From under Esthwaite's
          splitting fields of ice<br /> The pent-up air, struggling to free
          itself,<br /> Gave out to meadow grounds and hills a loud<br />
          Protracted yelling, like the noise of wolves<br /> Howling in troops
          along the Bothnic Main.<br /><br /> Nor, sedulous as I have been to
          trace<br /> How Nature by extrinsic passion first<br /> Peopled the mind
          with forms sublime or fair,<br /> And made me love them, may I here
          omit<br /> How other pleasures have been mine, and joys<br /> Of subtler
          origin; how I have felt,<br /> Not seldom even in that tempestuous
          time,<br /> Those hallowed and pure motions of the sense<br /> Which
          seem, in their simplicity, to own<br /> An intellectual charm; that
          calm delight<br /> Which, if I err not, surely must belong<br /> To
          those first-born affinities that fit<br /> Our new existence to
          existing things,<br /> And, in our dawn of being, constitute<br /> The
          bond of union between life and joy.<br /><br /> Yes, I remember when the
          changeful earth,<br /> And twice five summers on my mind had stamped<br />
          The faces of the moving year, even then<br /> I held unconscious
          intercourse with beauty<br /> Old as creation, drinking in a pure<br />
          Organic pleasure from the silver wreaths<br /> Of curling mist, or from
          the level plain<br /> Of waters coloured by impending clouds.<br /><br />
          The sands of Westmoreland, the creeks and bays<br /> Of Cumbria's rocky
          limits, they can tell<br /> How, when the Sea threw off his evening
          shade,<br /> And to the shepherd's hut on distant hills<br /> Sent
          welcome notice of the rising moon,<br /> How I have stood, to fancies
          such as these<br /> A stranger, linking with the spectacle<br /> No
          conscious memory of a kindred sight,<br /> And bringing with me no
          peculiar sense<br /> Of quietness or peace; yet have I stood,<br /> Even
          while mine eye hath moved o'er many a league<br /> Of shining water,
          gathering as it seemed<br /> Through every hair-breadth in that field
          of light<br /> New pleasure like a bee among the flowers.<br /><br />
          Thus oft amid those fits of vulgar joy<br /> Which, through all
          seasons, on a child's pursuits<br /> Are prompt attendants, 'mid that
          giddy bliss<br /> Which, like a tempest, works along the blood<br /> And
          is forgotten; even then I felt<br /> Gleams like the flashing of a
          shield;&mdash;the earth<br /> And common face of Nature spake to me<br />
          Rememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,<br /> By chance collisions
          and quaint accidents<br /> (Like those ill-sorted unions, work supposed<br />
          Of evil-minded fairies), yet not vain<br /> Nor profitless, if haply
          they impressed<br /> Collateral objects and appearances,<br /> Albeit
          lifeless then, and doomed to sleep<br /> Until maturer seasons called
          them forth<br /> To impregnate and to elevate the mind.<br /> &mdash;And
          if the vulgar joy by its own weight<br /> Wearied itself out of the
          memory,<br /> The scenes which were a witness of that joy<br /> Remained
          in their substantial lineaments<br /> Depicted on the brain, and to the
          eye<br /> Were visible, a daily sight; and thus<br /> By the impressive
          discipline of fear,<br /> By pleasure and repeated happiness,<br /> So
          frequently repeated, and by force<br /> Of obscure feelings
          representative<br /> Of things forgotten, these same scenes so bright,<br />
          So beautiful, so majestic in themselves,<br /> Though yet the day was
          distant, did become<br /> Habitually dear, and all their forms<br /> And
          changeful colours by invisible links<br /> Were fastened to the
          affections.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began<br /> My story early&mdash;not misled, I
          trust,<br /> By an infirmity of love for days<br /> Disowned by memory&mdash;ere
          the breath of spring<br /> Planting my snowdrops among winter snows:<br />
          Nor will it seem to thee, O Friend! so prompt<br /> In sympathy, that I
          have lengthened out<br /> With fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale.<br />
          Meanwhile, my hope has been, that I might fetch<br /> Invigorating
          thoughts from former years;<br /> Might fix the wavering balance of my
          mind,<br /> And haply meet reproaches too, whose power<br /> May spur me
          on, in manhood now mature<br /> To honourable toil. Yet should these
          hopes<br /> Prove vain, and thus should neither I be taught<br /> To
          understand myself, nor thou to know<br /> With better knowledge how the
          heart was framed<br /> Of him thou lovest; need I dread from thee<br />
          Harsh judgments, if the song be loth to quit<br /> Those recollected
          hours that have the charm<br /> Of visionary things, those lovely forms<br />
          And sweet sensations that throw back our life,<br /> And almost make
          remotest infancy<br /> A visible scene, on which the sun is shining?<br /><br />
          One end at least hath been attained; my mind<br /> Hath been revived,
          and if this genial mood<br /> Desert me not, forthwith shall be brought
          down<br /> Through later years the story of my life.<br /> The road lies
          plain before me;&mdash;'tis a theme<br /> Single and of determined
          bounds; and hence<br /> I choose it rather at this time, than work<br />
          Of ampler or more varied argument,<br /> Where I might be discomfited
          and lost:<br /> And certain hopes are with me, that to thee<br /> This
          labour will be welcome, honoured Friend!<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a

      &nbsp; <span style="color: #555555;">On the authority of the poet's
      nephew, and others, the "city" here referred to has invariably been
      supposed to be Goslar, where he spent the winter of 1799. Goslar, however,
      is as unlike a "vast city" as it is possible to conceive. Wordsworth could
      have walked from end to end of it in ten minutes.<br /> <br /> One would
      think he was rather referring to London, but there is no evidence to show
      that he visited the metropolis in the spring of 1799. The lines which
      follow about "the open fields" (l. 50) are certainly more appropriate to a
      journey from London to Sockburn, than from Goslar to Gottingen; and what
      follows, the "green shady place" of l. 62, the "known Vale" and the
      "cottage" of ll. 72 and 74, certainly refer to English soil.&mdash;Ed.</span><br />

      committed suicide. I cannot trace the legend of Mithridates becoming Odin.

      story. Gibbon (<i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, chap. x.)

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "It is supposed that Odin was the chief of a tribe of barbarians, who
        dwelt on the banks of Lake Maeotis, till the fall of Mithridates, and
        the arms of Pompey menaced the north with servitude; that Odin, yielding
        with indignant fury to a power which he was unable to resist, conducted
        his tribe from the frontiers of Asiatic Sarmatia into Sweden."

      Pike o'Blisco. Mr. Rawnsley, however, is of opinion that if Wordsworth
      rowed off from the west bank of Fasthwaite, he might see beyond the craggy
      ridge of Loughrigg the mass of Nab-Scar, and Rydal Head would rise up
      "black and huge." If he rowed from the east side, then Pike o'Stickle, or
      Harrison Stickle, might rise above Ironkeld, over Borwick Ground.&mdash;Ed.</span><br />

      lived with one Anne Tyson, for whom he ever afterwards cherished the
      warmest regard, and whose simple character he has immortalised. (See
      especially in the <a href="#24b4">fourth book</a> of <i>The Prelude</i>,
      p. 187, etc.) Wordsworth lived in her cottage at Hawkshead during nine
      eventful years. It still remains externally unaltered, and little, if at
      all, changed in the interior. It may be reached through a picturesque
      archway, near the principal inn of the village (The Lion); and is on the
      right of a small open yard, which is entered through this archway. To the
      left, a lane leads westwards to the open country. It is a humble dwelling
      of two storeys. The floor of the basement flat-paved with the blue flags
      of Coniston slate &mdash;is not likely to have been changed since
      Wordsworth's time. The present door with its "latch" (see book ii. l.
      339), is probably the same as that referred to in the poem, as in use in
      1776, and onwards. For further details see <a href="#24b4A">notes</a> to

        I tread the mazes of this argument, and paint<br /> How nature by
        collateral interest<br /> And by extrinsic passion peopled first<br /> My
        mind with beauteous objects: may I well<br /> Forget what might demand a
        loftier song,<br /> For oft the Eternal Spirit, He that has<br /> His Life
        in unimaginable things,<br /> And he who painting what He is in all<br />
        The visible imagery of all the World<br /> Is yet apparent chiefly as the
        Soul<br /> Of our first sympathies&mdash;O bounteous power<br /> In
        Childhood, in rememberable days<br /> How often did thy love renew for me<br />
        Those naked feelings which, when thou would'st form<br /> A living thing,
        thou sendest like a breeze<br /> Into its infant being! Soul of things<br />
        How often did thy love renew for me<br /> Those hallowed and pure motions
        of the sense<br /> Which seem in their simplicity to own<br /> An
        intellectual charm: That calm delight<br /> Which, if I err not, surely
        must belong<br /> To those first-born affinities which fit<br /> Our new
        existence to existing things,<br /> And, in our dawn of being, constitute<br />
        The bond of union betwixt life and joy.<br /> Yes, I remember, when the
        changeful youth<br /> And twice five seasons on my mind had stamped<br />
        The faces of the moving year, even then<br /> A child, I held unconscious
        intercourse<br /> With the eternal beauty, drinking in<br /> A pure
        organic pleasure from the lines<br /> Of curling mist, or from the smooth
        expanse<br /> Of waters coloured by the clouds of Heaven.

          Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much<br /> Unvisited,
          endeavoured to retrace<br /> The simple ways in which my childhood
          walked;<br /> Those chiefly that first led me to the love<br /> Of
          rivers, woods, and fields. The passion yet<br /> Was in its birth,
          sustained as might befal<br /> By nourishment that came unsought; for
          still<br /> From week to week, from month to month, we lived<br /> A
          round of tumult. Duly were our games<br /> Prolonged in summer till the
          day-light failed:<br /> No chair remained before the doors; the bench<br />
          And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep<br /> The labourer, and the
          old man who had sate<br /> A later lingerer; yet the revelry<br />
          Continued and the loud uproar: at last,<br /> When all the ground was
          dark, and twinkling stars<br /> Edged the black clouds, home and to bed
          we went,<br /> Feverish with weary joints and beating minds.<br /> Ah!
          is there one who ever has been young,<br /> Nor needs a warning voice
          to tame the pride<br /> Of intellect and virtue's self-esteem?<br /> One
          is there, though the wisest and the best<br /> Of all mankind, who
          covets not at times<br /> Union that cannot be;&mdash;who would not
          give,<br /> If so he might, to duty and to truth<br /> The eagerness of
          infantine desire?<br /> A tranquillising spirit presses now<br /> On my
          corporeal frame, so wide appears<br /> The vacancy between me and those
          days<br /> Which yet have such self-presence in my mind,<br /> That,
          musing on them, often do I seem<br /> Two consciousnesses, conscious of
          myself<br /> And of some other Being. A rude mass<br /> Of native rock,
          left midway in the square<br /> Of our small market village, was the
          goal<br /> Or centre of these sports; and when, returned<br /> After
          long absence, thither I repaired,<br /> Gone was the old grey stone,
          and in its place<br /> A smart Assembly-room usurped the ground<br />
          That had been ours. There let the fiddle scream,<br /> And be ye happy!
          Yet, my Friends! I know<br /> That more than one of you will think with
          me<br /> Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame<br /> From whom
          the stone was named, who there had sate,<br /> And watched her table
          with its huckster's wares<br /> Assiduous, through the length of sixty
          years.<br /><br /> We ran a boisterous course; the year span round<br />
          With giddy motion. But the time approached<br /> That brought with it a
          regular desire<br /> For calmer pleasures, when the winning forms<br />
          Of Nature were collaterally attached<br /> To every scheme of holiday
          delight<br /> And every boyish sport, less grateful else<br /> And
          languidly pursued.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When summer came,<br /> Our pastime was, on bright
          half-holidays,<br /> To sweep, along the plain of Windermere<br /> With
          rival oars; and the selected bourne<br /> Was now an Island musical
          with birds<br /> That sang and ceased not; now a Sister Isle<br />
          Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown<br /> With lilies of the
          valley like a field;<br /> And now a third small Island, where survived<br />
          In solitude the ruins of a shrine<br /> Once to Our Lady dedicate, and
          served<br /> Daily with chaunted rites. In such a race<br /> So ended,
          disappointment could be none,<br /> Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:<br />
          We rested in the shade, all pleased alike,<br /> Conquered and
          conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,<br /> And the vain-glory of
          superior skill,<br /> Were tempered; thus was gradually produced<br /> A
          quiet independence of the heart;<br /> And to my Friend who knows me I
          may add,<br /> Fearless of blame, that hence for future days<br />
          Ensued a diffidence and modesty,<br /> And I was taught to feel,
          perhaps too much,<br /> The self-sufficing power of Solitude.<br /><br />
          Our daily meals were frugal, Sabine fare!<br /> More than we wished we
          knew the blessing then<br /> Of vigorous hunger&mdash;hence corporeal
          strength<br /> Unsapped by delicate viands; for, exclude<br /> A little
          weekly stipend, and we lived<br /> Through three divisions of the
          quartered year<br /> In penniless poverty. But now to school<br /> From
          the half-yearly holidays returned,<br /> We came with weightier purses,
          that sufficed<br /> To furnish treats more costly than the Dame<br /> Of
          the old grey stone, from her scant board, supplied.<br /> Hence rustic
          dinners on the cool green ground,<br /> Or in the woods, or by a river
          side<br /> Or shady fountains, while among the leaves<br /> Soft airs
          were stirring, and the mid-day sun<br /> Unfelt shone brightly round us
          in our joy.<br /> Nor is my aim neglected if I tell<br /> How sometimes,
          in the length of those half-years,<br /> We from our funds drew
          largely;&mdash;proud to curb,<br /> And eager to spur on, the galloping
          steed;<br /> And with the courteous inn-keeper, whose stud<br />
          Supplied our want, we haply might employ<br /> Sly subterfuge, if the
          adventure's bound<br /> Were distant: some famed temple where of yore<br />
          The Druids worshipped, or the antique walls<br /> Of that large abbey,
          where within the Vale<br /> Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built,<br />
          Stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch,<br /> Belfry, and
          images, and living trees,<br /> A holy scene! Along the smooth green
          turf<br /> Our horses grazed. To more than inland peace<br /> Left by
          the west wind sweeping overhead<br /> From a tumultuous ocean, trees
          and towers<br /> In that sequestered valley may be seen,<br /> Both
          silent and both motionless alike;<br /> Such the deep shelter that is
          there, and such<br /> The safeguard for repose and quietness.<br /><br />
          Our steeds remounted and the summons given,<br /> With whip and spur we
          through the chauntry flew<br /> In uncouth race, and left the
          cross-legged knight,<br /> And the stone-abbot, and that single wren<br />
          Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave<br /> Of the old church, that&mdash;though
          from recent showers<br /> The earth was comfortless, and touched by
          faint<br /> Internal breezes, sobbings of the place<br /> And
          respirations, from the roofless walls<br /> The shuddering ivy dripped
          large drops&mdash;yet still<br /> So sweetly 'mid the gloom the
          invisible bird<br /> Sang to herself, that there I could have made<br />
          My dwelling-place, and lived for ever there<br /> To hear such music.
          Through the walls we flew<br /> And down the valley, and, a circuit
          made<br /> In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth<br /> We
          scampered homewards. Oh, ye rocks and streams,<br /> And that still
          spirit shed from evening air!<br /> Even in this joyous time I
          sometimes felt<br /> Your presence, when with slackened step we
          breathed<br /> Along the sides of the steep hills, or when<br /> Lighted
          by gleams of moonlight from the sea<br /> We beat with thundering hoofs
          the level sand.<br /><br /> Midway on long Winander's eastern shore,<br />
          Within the crescent of a pleasant bay,<br /> A tavern stood; no
          homely-featured house,<br /> Primeval like its neighbouring cottages,<br />
          But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset<br /> With chaises, grooms,
          and liveries, and within<br /> Decanters, glasses, and the blood-red
          wine.<br /> In ancient times, and ere the Hall was built<br /> On the
          large island, had this dwelling been<br /> More worthy of a poet's
          love, a hut,<br /> Proud of its own bright fire and sycamore shade.<br />
          But&mdash;though the rhymes were gone that once inscribed<br /> The
          threshold, and large golden characters,<br /> Spread o'er the spangled
          sign-board, had dislodged<br /> The old Lion and usurped his place, in
          slight<br /> And mockery of the rustic painter's hand&mdash;<br /> Yet,
          to this hour, the spot to me is dear<br /> With all its foolish pomp.
          The garden lay<br /> Upon a slope surmounted by a plain<br /> Of a small
          bowling-green; beneath us stood<br /> A grove, with gleams of water
          through the trees<br /> And over the tree-tops; nor did we want<br />
          Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.<br /> There, while through
          half an afternoon we played<br /> On the smooth platform, whether skill
          prevailed<br /> Or happy blunder triumphed, bursts of glee<br /> Made
          all the mountains ring. But, ere night-fall,<br /> When in our pinnace
          we returned at leisure<br /> Over the shadowy lake, and to the beach<br />
          Of some small island steered our course with one,<br /> The Minstrel of
          the Troop, and left him there,<br /> And rowed off gently, while he
          blew his flute<br /> Alone upon the rock&mdash;oh, then, the calm<br />
          And dead still water lay upon my mind<br /> Even with a weight of
          pleasure, and the sky,<br /> Never before so beautiful, sank down<br />
          Into my heart, and held me like a dream!<br /> Thus were my sympathies
          enlarged, and thus<br /> Daily the common range of visible things<br />
          Grew dear to me: already I began<br /> To love the sun; a boy I loved
          the sun,<br /> Not as I since have loved him, as a pledge<br /> And
          surety of our earthly life, a light<br /> Which we behold and feel we
          are alive;<br /> Nor for his bounty to so many worlds&mdash;<br /> But
          for this cause, that I had seen him lay<br /> His beauty on the morning
          hills, had seen<br /> The western mountain touch his setting orb,<br />
          In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess<br /> Of happiness, my
          blood appeared to flow<br /> For its own pleasure, and I breathed with
          joy.<br /> And, from like feelings, humble though intense,<br /> To
          patriotic and domestic love<br /> Analogous, the moon to me was dear;<br />
          For I could dream away my purposes,<br /> Standing to gaze upon her
          while she hung<br /> Midway between the hills, as if she knew<br /> No
          other region, but belonged to thee,<br /> Yea, appertained by a
          peculiar right<br /> To thee and thy grey huts, thou one dear Vale!<br /><br />
          Those incidental charms which first attached<br /> My heart to rural
          objects, day by day<br /> Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell<br /> How
          Nature, intervenient till this time<br /> And secondary, now at length
          was sought<br /> For her own sake. But who shall parcel out<br /> His
          intellect by geometric rules,<br /> Split like a province into round
          and square?<br /> Who knows the individual hour in which<br /> His
          habits were first sown, even as a seed?<br /> Who that shall point as
          with a wand and say<br /> "This portion of the river of my mind<br />
          Came from yon fountain?" Thou, my Friend! art one<br /> More deeply
          read in thy own thoughts; to thee<br /> Science appears but what in
          truth she is,<br /> Not as our glory and our absolute boast,<br /> But
          as a succedaneum, and a prop<br /> To our infirmity. No officious slave<br />
          Art thou of that false secondary power<br /> By which we multiply
          distinctions; then,<br /> Deem that our puny boundaries are things<br />
          That we perceive, and not that we have made.<br /> To thee, unblinded
          by these formal arts,<br /> The unity of all hath been revealed,<br />
          And thou wilt doubt, with me less aptly skilled<br /> Than many are to
          range the faculties<br /> In scale and order, class the cabinet<br /> Of
          their sensations, and in voluble phrase<br /> Run through the history
          and birth of each<br /> As of a single independent thing.<br /> Hard
          task, vain hope, to analyse the mind,<br /> If each most obvious and
          particular thought,<br /> Not in a mystical and idle sense,<br /> But in
          the words of Reason deeply weighed,<br /> Hath no beginning.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Blest the infant Babe,<br /> (For with my best conjecture I would trace<br />
          Our Being's earthly progress,) blest the Babe,<br /> Nursed in his
          Mother's arms, who sinks to sleep<br /> Rocked on his Mother's breast;
          who with his soul<br /> Drinks in the feelings of his Mother's eye!<br />
          For him, in one dear Presence, there exists<br /> A virtue which
          irradiates and exalts<br /> Objects through widest intercourse of
          sense.<br /> No outcast he, bewildered and depressed:<br /> Along his
          infant veins are interfused<br /> The gravitation and the filial bond<br />
          Of nature that connect him with the world.<br /> Is there a flower, to
          which he points with hand<br /> Too weak to gather it, already love<br />
          Drawn from love's purest earthly fount for him<br /> Hath beautified
          that flower; already shades<br /> Of pity cast from inward tenderness<br />
          Do fall around him upon aught that bears<br /> Unsightly marks of
          violence or harm.<br /> Emphatically such a Being lives,<br /> Frail
          creature as he is, helpless as frail,<br /> An inmate of this active
          universe.<br /> For feeling has to him imparted power<br /> That through
          the growing faculties of sense<br /> Doth like an agent of the one
          great Mind<br /> Create, creator and receiver both,<br /> Working but in
          alliance with the works<br /> Which it beholds. Such, verily, is the
          first<br /> Poetic spirit of our human life,<br /> By uniform control of
          after years,<br /> In most, abated or suppressed; in some,<br /> Through
          every change of growth and of decay,<br /> Pre-eminent till death.<br /><br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          From early days,<br /> Beginning not long after that first time<br /> In
          which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch<br /> I held mute dialogues with
          my Mother's heart,<br /> I have endeavoured to display the means<br />
          Whereby this infant sensibility,<br /> Great birthright of our being,
          was in me<br /> Augmented and sustained. Yet is a path<br /> More
          difficult before me; and I fear<br /> That in its broken windings we
          shall need<br /> The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:<br /> For
          now a trouble came into my mind<br /> From unknown causes. I was left
          alone<br /> Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why.<br /> The props
          of my affections were removed,<br /> And yet the building stood, as if
          sustained<br /> By its own spirit! All that I beheld<br /> Was dear, and
          hence to finer influxes<br /> The mind lay open to a more exact<br />
          And close communion. Many are our joys<br /> In youth, but oh! what
          happiness to live<br /> When every hour brings palpable access<br /> Of
          knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,<br /> And sorrow is not
          there! The seasons came,<br /> And every season wheresoe'er I moved<br />
          Unfolded transitory qualities,<br /> Which, but for this most watchful
          power of love,<br /> Had been neglected; left a register<br /> Of
          permanent relations, else unknown.<br /> Hence life, and change, and
          beauty, solitude<br /> More active even than "best society"&mdash;<br />
          Society made sweet as solitude<br /> By silent inobtrusive sympathies&mdash;<br />
          And gentle agitations of the mind<br /> From manifold distinctions,
          difference<br /> Perceived in things, where, to the unwatchful eye,<br />
          No difference is, and hence, from the same source,<br /> Sublimer joy;
          for I would walk alone,<br /> Under the quiet stars, and at that time<br />
          Have felt whate'er there is of power in sound<br /> To breathe an
          elevated mood, by form<br /> Or image unprofaned; and I would stand,<br />
          If the night blackened with a coming storm,<br /> Beneath some rock,
          listening to notes that are<br /> The ghostly language of the ancient
          earth,<br /> Or make their dim abode in distant winds.<br /> Thence did
          I drink the visionary power;<br /> And deem not profitless those
          fleeting moods<br /> Of shadowy exultation: not for this,<br /> That
          they are kindred to our purer mind<br /> And intellectual life; but
          that the soul,<br /> Remembering how she felt, but what she felt<br />
          Remembering not, retains an obscure sense<br /> Of possible sublimity,
          whereto<br /> With growing faculties she doth aspire,<br /> With
          faculties still growing, feeling still<br /> That whatsoever point they
          gain, they yet<br /> Have something to pursue.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not
          alone,<br /> 'Mid gloom and tumult, but no less 'mid fair<br /> And
          tranquil scenes, that universal power<br /> And fitness in the latent
          qualities<br /> And essences of things, by which the mind<br /> Is moved
          with feelings of delight, to me<br /> Came, strengthened with a
          superadded soul,<br /> A virtue not its own. My morning walks<br /> Were
          early;&mdash;oft before the hours of school<br /> I travelled round our
          little lake, five miles<br /> Of pleasant wandering. Happy time! more
          dear<br /> For this, that one was by my side, a Friend,<br /> Then
          passionately loved; with heart how full<br /> Would he peruse these
          lines! For many years<br /> Have since flowed in between us, and, our
          minds<br /> Both silent to each other, at this time<br /> We live as if
          those hours had never been.<br /> Nor seldom did I lift&mdash;our
          cottage latch<br /> Far earlier, ere one smoke-wreath had risen<br />
          From human dwelling, or the vernal thrush<br /> Was audible; and sate
          among the woods<br /> Alone upon some jutting eminence,<br /> At the
          first gleam of dawn-light, when the Vale,<br /> Yet slumbering, lay in
          utter solitude.<br /> How shall I seek the origin? where find<br />
          Faith in the marvellous things which then I felt?<br /> Oft in these
          moments such a holy calm<br /> Would overspread my soul, that bodily
          eyes<br /> Were utterly forgotten, and what I saw<br /> Appeared like
          something in myself, a dream,<br /> A prospect in the mind.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Twere long
          to tell<br /> What spring and autumn, what the winter snows,<br /> And
          what the summer shade, what day and night,<br /> Evening and morning,
          sleep and waking, thought<br /> From sources inexhaustible, poured
          forth<br /> To feed the spirit of religious love<br /> In which I walked
          with Nature. But let this<br /> Be not forgotten, that I still retained<br />
          My first creative sensibility;<br /> That by the regular action of the
          world<br /> My soul was unsubdued. A plastic power<br /> Abode with me;
          a forming hand, at times<br /> Rebellious, acting in a devious mood;<br />
          A local spirit of his own, at war<br /> With general tendency, but, for
          the most,<br /> Subservient strictly to external things<br /> With which
          it communed. An auxiliar light<br /> Came from my mind, which on the
          setting sun<br /> Bestowed new splendour; the melodious birds,<br /> The
          fluttering breezes, fountains that run on<br /> Murmuring so sweetly in
          themselves, obeyed<br /> A like dominion, and the midnight storm<br />
          Grew darker in the presence of my eye:<br /> Hence my obeisance, my
          devotion hence,<br /> And hence my transport.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor should
          this, perchance,<br /> Pass unrecorded, that I still had loved<br /> The
          exercise and produce of a toil,<br /> Than analytic industry to me<br />
          More pleasing, and whose character I deem<br /> Is more poetic as
          resembling more<br /> Creative agency. The song would speak<br /> Of
          that interminable building reared<br /> By observation of affinities<br />
          In objects where no brotherhood exists<br /> To passive minds. My
          seventeenth year was come;<br /> And, whether from this habit rooted
          now<br /> So deeply in my mind; or from excess<br /> In the great social
          principle of life<br /> Coercing all things into sympathy,<br /> To
          unorganic natures were transferred<br /> My own enjoyments; or the
          power of truth<br /> Coming in revelation, did converse<br /> With
          things that really are; I, at this time,<br /> Saw blessings spread
          around me like a sea.<br /> Thus while the days flew by, and years
          passed on,<br /> From Nature and her overflowing soul,<br /> I had
          received so much, that all my thoughts<br /> Were steeped in feeling; I
          was only then<br /> Contented, when with bliss ineffable<br /> I felt
          the sentiment of Being spread<br /> O'er all that moves and all that
          seemeth still;<br /> O'er all that, lost beyond the reach of thought<br />
          And human knowledge, to the human eye<br /> Invisible, yet liveth to
          the heart;<br /> O'er all that leaps and runs, and shouts and sings,<br />
          Or beats the gladsome air; o'er all that glides<br /> Beneath the wave,
          yea, in the wave itself,<br /> And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not<br />
          If high the transport, great the joy I felt,<br /> Communing in this
          sort through earth and heaven<br /> With every form of creature, as it
          looked<br /> Towards the Uncreated with a countenance<br /> Of
          adoration, with an eye of love.<br /> One song they sang, and it was
          audible,<br /> Most audible, then, when the fleshly ear,<br /> O'ercome
          by humblest prelude of that strain,<br /> Forgot her functions, and
          slept undisturbed.<br /><br /> If this be error, and another faith<br />
          Find easier access to the pious mind,<br /> Yet were I grossly
          destitute of all<br /> Those human sentiments that make this earth<br />
          So dear, if I should fail with grateful voice<br /> To speak of you, ye
          mountains, and ye lakes<br /> And sounding cataracts, ye mists and
          winds<br /> That dwell among the hills where I was born.<br /> If in my
          youth I have been pure in heart,<br /> If, mingling with the world, I
          am content<br /> With my own modest pleasures, and have lived<br /> With
          God and Nature communing, removed<br /> From little enmities and low
          desires,<br /> The gift is yours; if in these times of fear,<br /> This
          melancholy waste of hopes o'erthrown,<br /> If, 'mid indifference and
          apathy,<br /> And wicked exultation when good men<br /> On every side
          fall off, we know not how,<br /> To selfishness, disguised in gentle
          names<br /> Of peace and quiet and domestic love,<br /> Yet mingled not
          unwillingly with sneers<br /> On visionary minds; if, in this time<br />
          Of dereliction and dismay, I yet<br /> Despair not of our nature, but
          retain<br /> A more than Roman confidence, a faith<br /> That fails not,
          in all sorrow my support,<br /> The blessing of my life; the gift is
          yours,<br /> Ye winds and sounding cataracts! 'tis yours,<br /> Ye
          mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed<br /> My lofty speculations;
          and in thee,<br /> For this uneasy heart of ours, I find<br /> A
          never-failing principle of joy<br /> And purest passion.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou, my
          Friend! wert reared<br /> In the great city, 'mid far other scenes;<br />
          But we, by different roads, at length have gained<br /> The self-same
          bourne. And for this cause to thee<br /> I speak, unapprehensive of
          contempt,<br /> The insinuated scoff of coward tongues,<br /> And all
          that silent language which so oft<br /> In conversation between man and
          man<br /> Blots from the human countenance all trace<br /> Of beauty and
          of love. For thou hast sought<br /> The truth in solitude, and, since
          the days<br /> That gave thee liberty, full long desired,<br /> To serve
          in Nature's temple, thou hast been<br /> The most assiduous of her
          ministers;<br /> In many things my brother, chiefly here<br /> In this
          our deep devotion.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fare thee well!<br /> Health and the quiet of a
          healthful mind<br /> Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,<br />
          And yet more often living with thyself,<br /> And for thyself, so haply
          shall thy days<br /> Be many, and a blessing to mankind.<br /> <br />

          It was a dreary morning when the wheels<br /> Rolled over a wide plain
          o'erhung with clouds,<br /> And nothing cheered our way till first we
          saw<br /> The long-roofed chapel of King's College lift<br /> Turrets
          and pinnacles in answering files,<br /> Extended high above a dusky
          grove, [A]<br /><br /> Advancing, we espied upon the road<br /> A student
          clothed in gown and tasselled cap,<br /> Striding along as if
          o'ertasked by Time,<br /> Or covetous of exercise and air;<br /> He
          passed&mdash;nor was I master of my eyes<br /> Till he was left an
          arrow's flight behind.<br /> As near and nearer to the spot we drew,<br />
          It seemed to suck us in with an eddy's force.<br /> Onward we drove
          beneath the Castle; caught,<br /> While crossing Magdalene Bridge, a
          glimpse of Cam;<br /> And at the <i>Hoop</i> alighted, famous Inn. [B]<br /><br />
          My spirit was up, my thoughts were full of hope;<br /> Some friends I
          had, acquaintances who there<br /> Seemed friends, poor simple
          school-boys, now hung round<br /> With honour and importance: in a
          world<br /> Of welcome faces up and down I roved;<br /> Questions,
          directions, warnings and advice,<br /> Flowed in upon me, from all
          sides; fresh day<br /> Of pride and pleasure! to myself I seemed<br /> A
          man of business and expense, and went<br /> From shop to shop about my
          own affairs,<br /> To Tutor or to Tailor, as befel,<br /> From street to
          street with loose and careless mind.<br /><br /> I was the Dreamer, they
          the Dream; I roamed<br /> Delighted through the motley spectacle;<br />
          Gowns, grave, or gaudy, doctors, students, streets,<br /> Courts,
          cloisters, flocks of churches, gateways, towers:<br /> Migration
          strange for a stripling of the hills,<br /> A northern villager.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          As if the change<br /> Had waited on some Fairy's wand, at once<br />
          Behold me rich in monies, and attired<br /> In splendid garb, with hose
          of silk, and hair<br /> Powdered like rimy trees, when frost is keen.<br />
          My lordly dressing-gown, I pass it by,<br /> With other signs of
          manhood that supplied<br /> The lack of beard.&mdash;The weeks went
          roundly on,<br /> With invitations, suppers, wine and fruit,<br />
          Smooth housekeeping within, and all without<br /> Liberal, and suiting
          gentleman's array.<br /><br /> The Evangelist St. John my patron was:<br />
          Three Gothic courts are his, and in the first<br /> Was my
          abiding-place, a nook obscure; [C]<br /> Right underneath, the College
          kitchens made<br /> A humming sound, less tuneable than bees,<br /> But
          hardly less industrious; with shrill notes<br /> Of sharp command and
          scolding intermixed.<br /> Near me hung Trinity's loquacious clock,<br />
          Who never let the quarters, night or day,<br /> Slip by him
          unproclaimed, and told the hours<br /> Twice over with a male and
          female voice.<br /> Her pealing organ was my neighbour too;<br /> And
          from my pillow, looking forth by light<br /> Of moon or favouring
          stars, I could behold<br /> The antechapel where the statue stood<br />
          Of Newton with his prism and silent face,<br /> The marble index of a
          mind for ever<br /> Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.<br /><br />
          Of College labours, of the Lecturer's room<br /> All studded round, as
          thick as chairs could stand,<br /> With loyal students faithful to
          their books,<br /> Half-and-half idlers, hardy recusants,<br /> And
          honest dunces&mdash;of important days,<br /> Examinations, when the man
          was weighed<br /> As in a balance! of excessive hopes,<br /> Tremblings
          withal and commendable fears,<br /> Small jealousies, and triumphs good
          or bad,<br /> Let others that know more speak as they know.<br /> Such
          glory was but little sought by me,<br /> And little won. Yet from the
          first crude days<br /> Of settling time in this untried abode,<br /> I
          was disturbed at times by prudent thoughts,<br /> Wishing to hope
          without a hope, some fears<br /> About my future worldly maintenance,<br />
          And, more than all, a strangeness in the mind,<br /> A feeling that I
          was not for that hour,<br /> Nor for that place. But wherefore be cast
          down?<br /> For (not to speak of Reason and her pure<br /> Reflective
          acts to fix the moral law<br /> Deep in the conscience, nor of
          Christian Hope,<br /> Bowing her head before her sister Faith<br /> As
          one far mightier), hither I had come,<br /> Bear witness Truth, endowed
          with holy powers<br /> And faculties, whether to work or feel.<br /> Oft
          when the dazzling show no longer new<br /> Had ceased to dazzle,
          ofttimes did I quit<br /> My comrades, leave the crowd, buildings and
          groves,<br /> And as I paced alone the level fields<br /> Far from those
          lovely sights and sounds sublime<br /> With which I had been
          conversant, the mind<br /> Drooped not; but there into herself
          returning,<br /> With prompt rebound seemed fresh as heretofore.<br />
          At least I more distinctly recognised<br /> Her native instincts: let
          me dare to speak<br /> A higher language, say that now I felt<br /> What
          independent solaces were mine,<br /> To mitigate the injurious sway of
          place<br /> Or circumstance, how far soever changed<br /> In youth, or
          to be changed in manhood's prime;<br /> Or for the few who shall be
          called to look<br /> On the long shadows in our evening years,<br />
          Ordained precursors to the night of death.<br /> As if awakened,
          summoned, roused, constrained,<br /> I looked for universal things;
          perused<br /> The common countenance of earth and sky:<br /> Earth,
          nowhere unembellished by some trace<br /> Of that first Paradise whence
          man was driven;<br /> And sky, whose beauty and bounty are expressed<br />
          By the proud name she bears&mdash;the name of Heaven.<br /> I called on
          both to teach me what they might;<br /> Or turning the mind in upon
          herself<br /> Pored, watched, expected, listened, spread my thoughts<br />
          And spread them with a wider creeping; felt<br /> Incumbencies more
          awful, visitings<br /> Of the Upholder of the tranquil soul,<br /> That
          tolerates the indignities of Time,<br /> And, from the centre of
          Eternity<br /> All finite motions overruling, lives<br /> In glory
          immutable. But peace! enough<br /> Here to record that I was mounting
          now<br /> To such community with highest truth&mdash;<br /> A track
          pursuing, not untrod before,<br /> From strict analogies by thought
          supplied<br /> Or consciousnesses not to be subdued.<br /> To every
          natural form, rock, fruit or flower,<br /> Even the loose stones that
          cover the high-way,<br /> I gave a moral life: I saw them feel,<br /> Or
          linked them to some feeling: the great mass<br /> Lay bedded in a
          quickening soul, and all<br /> That I beheld respired with inward
          meaning.<br /> Add that whate'er of Terror or of Love<br /> Or Beauty,
          Nature's daily face put on<br /> From transitory passion, unto this<br />
          I was as sensitive as waters are<br /> To the sky's influence in a
          kindred mood<br /> Of passion; was obedient as a lute<br /> That waits
          upon the touches of the wind.<br /> Unknown, unthought of, yet I was
          most rich&mdash;<br /> I had a world about me&mdash;'twas my own;<br />
          I made it, for it only lived to me,<br /> And to the God who sees into
          the heart.<br /> Such sympathies, though rarely, were betrayed<br /> By
          outward gestures and by visible looks:<br /> Some called it madness&mdash;so
          indeed it was,<br /> If child-like fruitfulness in passing joy,<br /> If
          steady moods of thoughtfulness matured<br /> To inspiration, sort with
          such a name;<br /> If prophecy be madness; if things viewed<br /> By
          poets in old time, and higher up<br /> By the first men, earth's first
          inhabitants,<br /> May in these tutored days no more be seen<br /> With
          undisordered sight. But leaving this,<br /> It was no madness, for the
          bodily eye<br /> Amid my strongest workings evermore<br /> Was searching
          out the lines of difference<br /> As they lie hid in all external
          forms,<br /> Near or remote, minute or vast, an eye<br /> Which from a
          tree, a stone, a withered leaf,<br /> To the broad ocean and the azure
          heavens<br /> Spangled with kindred multitudes of stars,<br /> Could
          find no surface where its power might sleep;<br /> Which spake
          perpetual logic to my soul,<br /> And by an unrelenting agency<br /> Did
          bind my feelings even as in a chain.<br /><br /> And here, O Friend!
          have I retraced my life<br /> Up to an eminence, and told a tale<br />
          Of matters which not falsely may be called<br /> The glory of my youth.
          Of genius, power,<br /> Creation and divinity itself<br /> I have been
          speaking, for my theme has been<br /> What passed within me. Not of
          outward things<br /> Done visibly for other minds, words, signs,<br />
          Symbols or actions, but of my own heart<br /> Have I been speaking, and
          my youthful mind.<br /> O Heavens! how awful is the might of souls,<br />
          And what they do within themselves while yet<br /> The yoke of earth is
          new to them, the world<br /> Nothing but a wild field where they were
          sown.<br /> This is, in truth, heroic argument,<br /> This genuine
          prowess, which I wished to touch<br /> With hand however weak, but in
          the main<br /> It lies far hidden from the reach of words.<br /> Points
          have we all of us within our souls<br /> Where all stand single; this I
          feel, and make<br /> Breathings for incommunicable powers;<br /> But is
          not each a memory to himself?<br /> And, therefore, now that we must
          quit this theme,<br /> I am not heartless, for there's not a man<br />
          That lives who hath not known his god-like hours,<br /> And feels not
          what an empire we inherit<br /> As natural beings in the strength of
          Nature.<br /><br /> No more: for now into a populous plain<br /> We must
          descend. A Traveller I am,<br /> Whose tale is only of himself; even
          so,<br /> So be it, if the pure of heart be prompt<br /> To follow, and
          if thou, my honoured Friend!<br /> Who in these thoughts art ever at my
          side,<br /> Support, as heretofore, my fainting steps.<br /><br /> It
          hath been told, that when the first delight<br /> That flashed upon me
          from this novel show<br /> Had failed, the mind returned into herself;<br />
          Yet true it is, that I had made a change<br /> In climate, and my
          nature's outward coat<br /> Changed also slowly and insensibly.<br />
          Full oft the quiet and exalted thoughts<br /> Of loneliness gave way to
          empty noise<br /> And superficial pastimes; now and then<br /> Forced
          labour, and more frequently forced hopes;<br /> And, worst of all, a
          treasonable growth<br /> Of indecisive judgments, that impaired<br />
          And shook the mind's simplicity.&mdash;And yet<br /> This was a
          gladsome time. Could I behold&mdash;<br /> Who, less insensible than
          sodden clay<br /> In a sea-river's bed at ebb of tide,<br /> Could have
          beheld,&mdash;with undelighted heart,<br /> So many happy youths, so
          wide and fair<br /> A congregation in its budding-time<br /> Of health,
          and hope, and beauty, all at once<br /> So many divers samples from the
          growth<br /> Of life's sweet season&mdash;could have seen unmoved<br />
          That miscellaneous garland of wild flowers<br /> Decking the matron
          temples of a place<br /> So famous through the world? To me, at least,<br />
          It was a goodly prospect: for, in sooth,<br /> Though I had learnt
          betimes to stand unpropped,<br /> And independent musings pleased me so<br />
          That spells seemed on me when I was alone,<br /> Yet could I only
          cleave to solitude<br /> In lonely places; if a throng was near<br />
          That way I leaned by nature; for my heart<br /> Was social, and loved
          idleness and joy.<br /><br /> Not seeking those who might participate<br />
          My deeper pleasures (nay, I had not once,<br /> Though not unused to
          mutter lonesome songs,<br /> Even with myself divided such delight,<br />
          Or looked that way for aught that might be clothed<br /> In human
          language), easily I passed<br /> From the remembrances of better
          things,<br /> And slipped into the ordinary works<br /> Of careless
          youth, unburthened, unalarmed.<br /> <i>Caverns</i> there were within
          my mind which sun<br /> Could never penetrate, yet did there not<br />
          Want store of leafy <i>arbours</i> where the light<br /> Might enter in
          at will. Companionships,<br /> Friendships, acquaintances, were welcome
          all.<br /> We sauntered, played, or rioted; we talked<br /> Unprofitable
          talk at morning hours;<br /> Drifted about along the streets and walks,<br />
          Read lazily in trivial books, went forth<br /> To gallop through the
          country in blind zeal<br /> Of senseless horsemanship, or on the breast<br />
          Of Cam sailed boisterously, and let the stars<br /> Come forth, perhaps
          without one quiet thought.<br /><br /> Such was the tenor of the second
          act<br /> In this new life. Imagination slept,<br /> And yet not
          utterly. I could not print<br /> Ground where the grass had yielded to
          the steps<br /> Of generations of illustrious men,<br /> Unmoved. I
          could not always lightly pass<br /> Through the same gateways, sleep
          where they had slept,<br /> Wake where they waked, range that inclosure
          old,<br /> That garden of great intellects, undisturbed.<br /> Place
          also by the side of this dark sense<br /> Of noble feeling, that those
          spiritual men,<br /> Even the great Newton's own ethereal self,<br />
          Seemed humbled in these precincts thence to be<br /> The more endeared.
          Their several memories here<br /> (Even like their persons in their
          portraits clothed<br /> With the accustomed garb of daily life)<br />
          Put on a lowly and a touching grace<br /> Of more distinct humanity,
          that left<br /> All genuine admiration unimpaired.<br /><br /> Beside the
          pleasant Mill of Trompington [D]<br /> I laughed with Chaucer in the
          hawthorn shade;<br /> Heard him, while birds were warbling, tell his
          tales<br /> Of amorous passion. And that gentle Bard,<br /> Chosen by
          the Muses for their Page of State&mdash;<br /> Sweet Spenser, moving
          through his clouded heaven<br /> With the moon's beauty and the moon's
          soft pace,<br /> I called him Brother, Englishman, and Friend!<br />
          Yea, our blind Poet, who, in his later day,<br /> Stood almost single;
          uttering odious truth&mdash;<br /> Darkness before, and danger's voice
          behind,<br /> Soul awful&mdash;if the earth has ever lodged<br /> An
          awful soul&mdash;I seemed to see him here<br /> Familiarly, and in his
          scholar's dress<br /> Bounding before me, yet a stripling youth&mdash;<br />
          A boy, no better, with his rosy cheeks<br /> Angelical, keen eye,
          courageous look,<br /> And conscious step of purity and pride.<br />
          Among the band of my compeers was one<br /> Whom chance had stationed
          in the very room<br /> Honoured by Milton's name. O temperate Bard!<br />
          Be it confest that, for the first time, seated<br /> Within thy
          innocent lodge and oratory,<br /> One of a festive circle, I poured out<br />
          Libations, to thy memory drank, till pride<br /> And gratitude grew
          dizzy in a brain<br /> Never excited by the fumes of wine<br /> Before
          that hour, or since. Then, forth I ran<br /> From the assembly; through
          a length of streets,<br /> Ran, ostrich-like, to reach our chapel door<br />
          In not a desperate or opprobrious time,<br /> Albeit long after the
          importunate bell<br /> Had stopped, with wearisome Cassandra voice<br />
          No longer haunting the dark winter night.<br /> Call back, O Friend!
          [E] a moment to thy mind,<br /> The place itself and fashion of the
          rites.<br /> With careless ostentation shouldering up<br /> My surplice,
          [F] through the inferior throng I clove<br /> Of the plain Burghers,
          who in audience stood<br /> On the last skirts of their permitted
          ground,<br /> Under the pealing organ. Empty thoughts!<br /> I am
          ashamed of them: and that great Bard,<br /> And thou, O Friend! who in
          thy ample mind<br /> Hast placed me high above my best deserts,<br /> Ye
          will forgive the weakness of that hour,<br /> In some of its unworthy
          vanities,<br /> Brother to many more.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this mixed sort<br /> The
          months passed on, remissly, not given up<br /> To wilful alienation
          from the right,<br /> Or walks of open scandal, but in vague<br /> And
          loose indifference, easy likings, aims<br /> Of a low pitch&mdash;duty
          and zeal dismissed,<br /> Yet Nature, or a happy course of things<br />
          Not doing in their stead the needful work.<br /> The memory languidly
          revolved, the heart<br /> Reposed in noontide rest, the inner pulse<br />
          Of contemplation almost failed to beat.<br /> Such life might not
          inaptly be compared<br /> To a floating island, an amphibious spot<br />
          Unsound, of spongy texture, yet withal<br /> Not wanting a fair face of
          water weeds<br /> And pleasant flowers. [G] The thirst of living
          praise,<br /> Fit reverence for the glorious Dead, the sight<br /> Of
          those long vistas, sacred catacombs,<br /> Where mighty minds lie
          visibly entombed,<br /> Have often stirred the heart of youth, and bred<br />
          A fervent love of rigorous discipline.&mdash;<br /> Alas! such high
          emotion touched not me.<br /> Look was there none within these walls to
          shame<br /> My easy spirits, and discountenance<br /> Their light
          composure, far less to instil<br /> A calm resolve of mind, firmly
          addressed<br /> To puissant efforts. Nor was this the blame<br /> Of
          others, but my own; I should, in truth,<br /> As far as doth concern my
          single self,<br /> Misdeem most widely, lodging it elsewhere:<br /> For
          I, bred up 'mid Nature's luxuries,<br /> Was a spoiled child, and
          rambling like the wind,<br /> As I had done in daily intercourse<br />
          With those crystalline rivers, solemn heights,<br /> And mountains,
          ranging like a fowl of the air,<br /> I was ill-tutored for captivity;<br />
          To quit my pleasure, and, from month to month,<br /> Take up a station
          calmly on the perch<br /> Of sedentary peace. Those lovely forms<br />
          Had also left less space within my mind,<br /> Which, wrought upon
          instinctively, had found<br /> A freshness in those objects of her
          love,<br /> A winning power, beyond all other power.<br /> Not that I
          slighted books, [H]&mdash;that were to lack<br /> All sense,&mdash;but
          other passions in me ruled,<br /> Passions more fervent, making me less
          prompt<br /> To in-door study than was wise or well,<br /> Or suited to
          those years. Yet I, though used<br /> In magisterial liberty to rove,<br />
          Culling such flowers of learning as might tempt<br /> A random choice,
          could shadow forth a place<br /> (If now I yield not to a flattering
          dream)<br /> Whose studious aspect should have bent me down<br /> To
          instantaneous service; should at once<br /> Have made me pay to science
          and to arts<br /> And written lore, acknowledged my liege lord,<br /> A
          homage frankly offered up, like that<br /> Which I had paid to Nature.
          Toil and pains<br /> In this recess, by thoughtful Fancy built,<br />
          Should spread from heart to heart; and stately groves,<br /> Majestic
          edifices, should not want<br /> A corresponding dignity within.<br />
          The congregating temper that pervades<br /> Our unripe years, not
          wasted, should be taught<br /> To minister to works of high attempt&mdash;<br />
          Works which the enthusiast would perform with love.<br /> Youth should
          be awed, religiously possessed<br /> With a conviction of the power
          that waits<br /> On knowledge, when sincerely sought and prized<br />
          For its own sake, on glory and on praise<br /> If but by labour won,
          and fit to endure<br /> The passing day; should learn to put aside<br />
          Her trappings here, should strip them off abashed<br /> Before
          antiquity and stedfast truth<br /> And strong book-mindedness; and over
          all<br /> A healthy sound simplicity should reign,<br /> A seemly
          plainness, name it what you will,<br /> Republican or pious.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          If these thoughts<br /> Are a gratuitous emblazonry<br /> That mocks the
          recreant age <i>we</i> live in, then<br /> Be Folly and False-seeming
          free to affect<br /> Whatever formal gait of discipline<br /> Shall
          raise them highest in their own esteem&mdash;<br /> Let them parade
          among the Schools at will,<br /> But spare the House of God. Was ever
          known<br /> The witless shepherd who persists to drive<br /> A flock
          that thirsts not to a pool disliked?<br /> A weight must surely hang on
          days begun<br /> And ended with such mockery. Be wise,<br /> Ye
          Presidents and Deans, and, till the spirit<br /> Of ancient times
          revive, and youth be trained<br /> At home in pious service, to your
          bells<br /> Give seasonable rest, for 'tis a sound<br /> Hollow as ever
          vexed the tranquil air;<br /> And your officious doings bring disgrace<br />
          On the plain steeples of our English Church,<br /> Whose worship, 'mid
          remotest village trees,<br /> Suffers for this. Even Science, too, at
          hand<br /> In daily sight of this irreverence,<br /> Is smitten thence
          with an unnatural taint,<br /> Loses her just authority, falls beneath<br />
          Collateral suspicion, else unknown.<br /> This truth escaped me not,
          and I confess,<br /> That having 'mid my native hills given loose<br />
          To a schoolboy's vision, I had raised a pile<br /> Upon the basis of
          the coming time,<br /> That fell in ruins round me. Oh, what joy<br />
          To see a sanctuary for our country's youth<br /> Informed with such a
          spirit as might be<br /> Its own protection; a primeval grove,<br />
          Where, though the shades with cheerfulness were filled,<br /> Nor
          indigent of songs warbled from crowds<br /> In under-coverts, yet the
          countenance<br /> Of the whole place should bear a stamp of awe;<br /> A
          habitation sober and demure<br /> For ruminating creatures; a domain<br />
          For quiet things to wander in; a haunt<br /> In which the heron should
          delight to feed<br /> By the shy rivers, and the pelican<br /> Upon the
          cypress spire in lonely thought<br /> Might sit and sun himself.&mdash;Alas!
          Alas!<br /> In vain for such solemnity I looked;<br /> Mine eyes were
          crossed by butterflies, ears vexed<br /> By chattering popinjays; the
          inner heart<br /> Seemed trivial, and the impresses without<br /> Of a
          too gaudy region.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Different sight<br /> Those venerable Doctors saw of
          old,<br /> When all who dwelt within these famous walls<br /> Led in
          abstemiousness a studious life;<br /> When, in forlorn and naked
          chambers cooped<br /> And crowded, o'er the ponderous books they hung<br />
          Like caterpillars eating out their way<br /> In silence, or with keen
          devouring noise<br /> Not to be tracked or fathered. Princes then<br />
          At matins froze, and couched at curfew-time,<br /> Trained up through
          piety and zeal to prize<br /> Spare diet, patient labour, and plain
          weeds.<br /> O seat of Arts! renowned throughout the world!<br /> Far
          different service in those homely days<br /> The Muses' modest
          nurslings underwent<br /> From their first childhood: in that glorious
          time<br /> When Learning, like a stranger come from far,<br /> Sounding
          through Christian lands her trumpet, roused<br /> Peasant and king;
          when boys and youths, the growth<br /> Of ragged villages and crazy
          huts,<br /> Forsook their homes, and, errant in the quest<br /> Of
          Patron, famous school or friendly nook,<br /> Where, pensioned, they in
          shelter might sit down,<br /> From town to town and through wide
          scattered realms<br /> Journeyed with ponderous folios in their hands;<br />
          And often, starting from some covert place,<br /> Saluted the chance
          comer on the road,<br /> Crying, "An obolus, a penny give<br /> To a
          poor scholar!" [I]&mdash;when illustrious men,<br /> Lovers of truth,
          by penury constrained,<br /> Bucer, Erasmus, or Melancthon, read<br />
          Before the doors or windows of their cells<br /> By moonshine through
          mere lack of taper light.<br /><br /> But peace to vain regrets! We see
          but darkly<br /> Even when we look behind us, and best things<br /> Are
          not so pure by nature that they needs<br /> Must keep to all, as fondly
          all believe,<br /> Their highest promise. If the mariner,<br /> When at
          reluctant distance he hath passed<br /> Some tempting island, could but
          know the ills<br /> That must have fallen upon him had he brought<br />
          His bark to land upon the wished-for shore,<br /> Good cause would oft
          be his to thank the surf<br /> Whose white belt scared him thence, or
          wind that blew<br /> Inexorably adverse: for myself<br /> I grieve not;
          happy is the gown&egrave;d youth,<br /> Who only misses what I missed,
          who falls<br /> No lower than I fell.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not
          love,<br /> Judging not ill perhaps, the timid course<br /> Of our
          scholastic studies; could have wished<br /> To see the river flow with
          ampler range<br /> And freer pace; but more, far more, I grieved<br />
          To see displayed among an eager few,<br /> Who in the field of contest
          persevered,<br /> Passions unworthy of youth's generous heart<br /> And
          mounting spirit, pitiably repaid,<br /> When so disturbed, whatever
          palms are won.<br /> From these I turned to travel with the shoal<br />
          Of more unthinking natures, easy minds<br /> And pillowy; yet not
          wanting love that makes<br /> The day pass lightly on, when foresight
          sleeps,<br /> And wisdom and the pledges interchanged<br /> With our own
          inner being are forgot.<br /><br /> Yet was this deep vacation not given
          up<br /> To utter waste. Hitherto I had stood<br /> In my own mind
          remote from social life,<br /> (At least from what we commonly so
          name,)<br /> Like a lone shepherd on a promontory<br /> Who lacking
          occupation looks far forth<br /> Into the boundless sea, and rather
          makes<br /> Than finds what he beholds. And sure it is,<br /> That this
          first transit from the smooth delights<br /> And wild outlandish walks
          of simple youth<br /> To something that resembles an approach<br />
          Towards human business, to a privileged world<br /> Within a world, a
          midway residence<br /> With all its intervenient imagery,<br /> Did
          better suit my visionary mind,<br /> Far better, than to have been
          bolted forth;<br /> Thrust out abruptly into Fortune's way<br /> Among
          the conflicts of substantial life;<br /> By a more just gradation did
          lead on<br /> To higher things; more naturally matured,<br /> For
          permanent possession, better fruits,<br /> Whether of truth or virtue,
          to ensue.<br /> In serious mood, but oftener, I confess,<br /> With
          playful zest of fancy did we note<br /> (How could we less?) the
          manners and the ways<br /> Of those who lived distinguished by the
          badge<br /> Of good or ill report; or those with whom<br /> By frame of
          Academic discipline<br /> We were perforce connected, men whose sway<br />
          And known authority of office served<br /> To set our minds on edge,
          and did no more.<br /> Nor wanted we rich pastime of this kind,<br />
          Found everywhere, but chiefly in the ring<br /> Of the grave Elders,
          men unsecured, grotesque<br /> In character, tricked out like aged
          trees<br /> Which through the lapse of their infirmity<br /> Give ready
          place to any random seed<br /> That chooses to be reared upon their
          trunks.<br /><br /> Here on my view, confronting vividly<br /> Those
          shepherd swains whom I had lately left,<br /> Appeared a different
          aspect of old age;<br /> How different! yet both distinctly marked,<br />
          Objects embossed to catch the general eye,<br /> Or portraitures for
          special use designed,<br /> As some might seem, so aptly do they serve<br />
          To illustrate Nature's book of rudiments&mdash;<br /> That book upheld
          as with maternal care<br /> When she would enter on her tender scheme<br />
          Of teaching comprehension with delight,<br /> And mingling playful with
          pathetic thoughts.<br /><br /> The surfaces of artificial life<br /> And
          manners finely wrought, the delicate race<br /> Of colours, lurking,
          gleaming up and down<br /> Through that state arras woven with silk and
          gold;<br /> This wily interchange of snaky hues,<br /> Willingly or
          unwillingly revealed,<br /> I neither knew nor cared for; and as such<br />
          Were wanting here, I took what might be found<br /> Of less elaborate
          fabric. At this day<br /> I smile, in many a mountain solitude<br />
          Conjuring up scenes as obsolete in freaks<br /> Of character, in points
          of wit as broad,<br /> As aught by wooden images performed<br /> For
          entertainment of the gaping crowd<br /> At wake or fair. And oftentimes
          do flit<br /> Remembrances before me of old men&mdash;<br /> Old
          humourists, who have been long in their graves,<br /> And having almost
          in my mind put off<br /> Their human names, have into phantoms passed<br />
          Of texture midway between life and books.<br /><br /> I play the
          loiterer: 'tis enough to note<br /> That here in dwarf proportions were
          expressed<br /> The limbs of the great world; its eager strifes<br />
          Collaterally pourtrayed, as in mock fight,<br /> A tournament of blows,
          some hardly dealt<br /> Though short of mortal combat; and whate'er<br />
          Might in this pageant be supposed to hit<br /> An artless rustic's
          notice, this way less,<br /> More that way, was not wasted upon me&mdash;<br />
          And yet the spectacle may well demand<br /> A more substantial name, no
          mimic show,<br /> Itself a living part of a live whole,<br /> A creek in
          the vast sea; for, all degrees<br /> And shapes of spurious fame and
          short-lived praise<br /> Here sate in state, and fed with daily alms<br />
          Retainers won away from solid good;<br /> And here was Labour, his own
          bond-slave; Hope,<br /> That never set the pains against the prize;<br />
          Idleness halting with his weary clog,<br /> And poor misguided Shame,
          and witless Fear,<br /> And simple Pleasure foraging for Death;<br />
          Honour misplaced, and Dignity astray;<br /> Feuds, factions,
          flatteries, enmity, and guile<br /> Murmuring submission, and bald
          government,<br /> (The idol weak as the idolater),<br /> And Decency and
          Custom starving Truth,<br /> And blind Authority beating with his staff<br />
          The child that might have led him; Emptiness<br /> Followed as of good
          omen, and meek Worth<br /> Left to herself unheard of and unknown.<br /><br />
          Of these and other kindred notices<br /> I cannot say what portion is
          in truth<br /> The naked recollection of that time,<br /> And what may
          rather have been called to life<br /> By after-meditation. But delight<br />
          That, in an easy temper lulled asleep,<br /> Is still with Innocence
          its own reward,<br /> This was not wanting. Carelessly I roamed<br /> As
          through a wide museum from whose stores<br /> A casual rarity is
          singled out<br /> And has its brief perusal, then gives way<br /> To
          others, all supplanted in their turn;<br /> Till 'mid this crowded
          neighbourhood of things<br /> That are by nature most unneighbourly,<br />
          The head turns round and cannot right itself;<br /> And though an
          aching and a barren sense<br /> Of gay confusion still be uppermost,<br />
          With few wise longings and but little love,<br /> Yet to the memory
          something cleaves at last,<br /> Whence profit may be drawn in times to
          come.<br /><br /> Thus in submissive idleness, my Friend!<br /> The
          labouring time of autumn, winter, spring,<br /> Eight months! rolled
          pleasingly away; the ninth<br /> Came and returned me to my native
          hills.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="#Ctoc">Contents&mdash;<i>The

      dozen years ago, although they are pretty clearly indicated by Wordsworth
      in this passage. They were in the first of the three courts of St. John's;
      they were above the College kitchens; and from the window of his bedroom
      he could look into the antechapel of Trinity, with its statue of Newton.
      They have been recently removed in connection with sundry improvements in
      the college kitchen. For details, see the <i>Life of Wordsworth</i> which

      speaking of her two brothers, William and Christopher. Of Christopher she
      says:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "His abilities, though not so great, perhaps, as his brother's, may be
        of more use to him, as he has not fixed his mind upon any particular
        species of reading or conceived an aversion to any. He is not fond of
        mathematics, but has resolution sufficient to study them; because it
        will be impossible for him to obtain a fellowship without them. William
        lost the chance, indeed the certainty, of a fellowship, by not combating
        his inclinations. He gave way to his natural dislike to studies so dry
        as many parts of the mathematics, consequently could not succeed in
        Cambridge. He reads Italian, Spanish, French, Greek, Latin, and English;
        but never opens a mathematical book.... Do not think from what I have
        said that he reads not at all; for he does read a great deal, and not
        only poetry, in these languages he is acquainted with, but History
        also," etc. etc.

          Bright was the summer's noon when quickening steps<br /> Followed each
          other till a dreary moor<br /> Was crossed, a bare ridge clomb, upon
          whose top [A]<br /> Standing alone, as from a rampart's edge,<br /> I
          overlooked the bed of Windermere,<br /> Like a vast river, stretching
          in the sun.<br /> With exultation, at my feet I saw<br /> Lake, islands,
          promontories, gleaming bays,<br /> A universe of Nature's fairest forms<br />
          Proudly revealed with instantaneous burst,<br /> Magnificent, and
          beautiful, and gay.<br /> I bounded down the hill shouting amain<br />
          For the old Ferryman; to the shout the rocks<br /> Replied, and when
          the Charon of the flood<br /> Had staid his oars, and touched the
          jutting pier, [B]<br /> I did not step into the well-known boat<br />
          Without a cordial greeting. Thence with speed<br /> Up the familiar
          hill I took my way [C]<br /> Towards that sweet Valley [D] where I had
          been reared;<br /> 'Twas but a short hour's walk, ere veering round<br />
          I saw the snow-white church upon her hill [E]<br /> Sit like a thron&egrave;d
          Lady, sending out<br /> A gracious look all over her domain. [F]<br />
          Yon azure smoke betrays the lurking town;<br /> With eager footsteps I
          advance and reach<br /> The cottage threshold where my journey closed.<br />
          Glad welcome had I, with some tears, perhaps,<br /> From my old Dame,
          so kind and motherly, [G]<br /> While she perused me with a parent's
          pride.<br /> The thoughts of gratitude shall fall like dew<br /> Upon
          thy grave, good creature! While my heart<br /> Can beat never will I
          forget thy name.<br /> Heaven's blessing be upon thee where thou liest<br />
          After thy innocent and busy stir<br /> In narrow cares, thy little
          daily growth<br /> Of calm enjoyments, after eighty years,<br /> And
          more than eighty, of untroubled life, [H]<br /> Childless, yet by the
          strangers to thy blood<br /> Honoured with little less than filial
          love.<br /> What joy was mine to see thee once again,<br /> Thee and thy
          dwelling, and a crowd of things<br /> About its narrow precincts all
          beloved, [I]<br /> And many of them seeming yet my own!<br /> Why should
          I speak of what a thousand hearts<br /> Have felt, and every man alive
          can guess?<br /> The rooms, the court, the garden were not left<br />
          Long unsaluted, nor the sunny seat<br /> Round the stone table under
          the dark pine, [K]<br /> Friendly to studious or to festive hours;<br />
          Nor that unruly child of mountain birth,<br /> The famous brook, who,
          soon as he was boxed<br /> Within our garden, [L] found himself at
          once,<br /> As if by trick insidious and unkind,<br /> Stripped of his
          voice [M] and left to dimple down<br /> (Without an effort and without
          a will)<br /> A channel paved by man's officious care. [N]<br /> I
          looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,<br /> And in the press of
          twenty thousand thoughts, [O]<br /> "Ha," quoth I, "pretty prisoner,
          are you there!"<br /> Well might sarcastic Fancy then have whispered,<br />
          "An emblem here behold of thy own life;<br /> In its late course of
          even days with all<br /> Their smooth enthralment;" but the heart was
          full,<br /> Too full for that reproach. My aged Dame<br /> Walked
          proudly at my side: she guided me;<br /> I willing, nay&mdash;nay,
          wishing to be led.<br /> &mdash;The face of every neighbour whom I met<br />
          Was like a volume to me; some were hailed<br /> Upon the road, some
          busy at their work,<br /> Unceremonious greetings interchanged<br />
          With half the length of a long field between.<br /> Among my
          schoolfellows I scattered round<br /> Like recognitions, but with some
          constraint<br /> Attended, doubtless, with a little pride,<br /> But
          with more shame, for my habiliments,<br /> The transformation wrought
          by gay attire.<br /> Not less delighted did I take my place<br /> At our
          domestic table: and, [P] dear Friend<br /> In this endeavour simply to
          relate<br /> A Poet's history, may I leave untold<br /> The thankfulness
          with which I laid me down<br /> In my accustomed bed, more welcome now<br />
          Perhaps than if it had been more desired<br /> Or been more often
          thought of with regret;<br /> That lowly bed whence I had heard the
          wind<br /> Roar and the rain beat hard, where I so oft<br /> Had lain
          awake on summer nights to watch<br /> The moon in splendour couched
          among the leaves<br /> Of a tall ash, that near our cottage stood; [Q]<br />
          Had watched her with fixed eyes while to and fro<br /> In the dark
          summit of the waving tree<br /> She rocked with every impulse of the
          breeze.<br /><br /> Among the favourites whom it pleased me well<br /> To
          see again, was one by ancient right<br /> Our inmate, a rough terrier
          of the hills;<br /> By birth and call of nature pre-ordained<br /> To
          hunt the badger and unearth the fox<br /> Among the impervious crags,
          but having been<br /> From youth our own adopted, he had passed<br />
          Into a gentler service. And when first<br /> The boyish spirit flagged,
          and day by day<br /> Along my veins I kindled with the stir,<br /> The
          fermentation, and the vernal heat<br /> Of poesy, affecting private
          shades<br /> Like a sick Lover, then this dog was used<br /> To watch
          me, an attendant and a friend,<br /> Obsequious to my steps early and
          late,<br /> Though often of such dilatory walk<br /> Tired, and uneasy
          at the halts I made.<br /> A hundred times when, roving high and low<br />
          I have been harassed with the toil of verse,<br /> Much pains and
          little progress, and at once<br /> Some lovely Image in the song rose
          up<br /> Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;<br /> Then have I
          darted forwards to let<br /> My hand upon his back with stormy joy,<br />
          Caressing him again and yet again.<br /> And when at evening on the
          public way<br /> I sauntered, like a river murmuring<br /> And talking
          to itself when all things<br /> Are still, the creature trotted on
          before;<br /> Such was his custom; but whene'er he met<br /> A passenger
          approaching, he would turn<br /> To give me timely notice, and
          straightway,<br /> Grateful for that admonishment, I<br /> My voice,
          composed my gait, and, with the air<br /> And mien of one whose
          thoughts are free, advanced<br /> To give and take a greeting that
          might save<br /> My name from piteous rumours, such as wait<br /> On men
          suspected to be crazed in brain.<br /><br /> Those walks well worthy to
          be prized and loved&mdash;<br /> Regretted!&mdash;that word, too, was
          on my tongue,<br /> But they were richly laden with all good,<br /> And
          cannot be remembered but with thanks<br /> And gratitude, and perfect
          joy of heart&mdash;<br /> Those walks in all their freshness now came
          back<br /> Like a returning Spring. When first I made<br /> Once more
          the circuit of our little lake,<br /> If ever happiness hath lodged
          with man,<br /> That day consummate happiness was mine,<br />
          Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.<br /> The sun was set, or
          setting, when I left<br /> Our cottage door, and evening soon brought
          on<br /> A sober hour, not winning or serene,<br /> For cold and raw the
          air was, and untuned;<br /> But as a face we love is sweetest then<br />
          When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look<br /> It chance to wear, is
          sweetest if the heart<br /> Have fulness in herself; even so with me<br />
          It fared that evening. Gently did my soul<br /> Put off her veil, and,
          self-transmuted, stood<br /> Naked, as in the presence of her God.<br />
          While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch<br /> A heart that had not
          been disconsolate:<br /> Strength came where weakness was not known to
          be,<br /> At least not felt; and restoration came<br /> Like an intruder
          knocking at the door<br /> Of unacknowledged weariness. I took<br /> The
          balance, and with firm hand weighed myself.<br /> &mdash;Of that
          external scene which round me lay,<br /> Little, in this abstraction,
          did I see;<br /> Remembered less; but I had inward hopes<br /> And
          swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,<br /> Conversed with
          promises, had glimmering views<br /> How life pervades the undecaying
          mind;<br /> How the immortal soul with God-like power<br /> Informs,
          creates, and thaws the deepest sleep<br /> That time can lay upon her;
          how on earth,<br /> Man, if he do but live within the light<br /> Of
          high endeavours, daily spreads abroad<br /> His being armed with
          strength that cannot fail.<br /> Nor was there want of milder thoughts,
          of love<br /> Of innocence, and holiday repose;<br /> And more than
          pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir<br /> Of boldest projects, and a peaceful
          end<br /> At last, or glorious, by endurance won.<br /> Thus musing, in
          a wood I sate me down<br /> Alone, continuing there to muse: the slopes<br />
          And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread<br /> With darkness, and
          before a rippling breeze<br /> The long lake lengthened out its hoary
          line,<br /> And in the sheltered coppice where I sate,<br /> Around me
          from among the hazel leaves,<br /> Now here, now there, moved by the
          straggling wind,<br /> Came ever and anon a breath-like sound,<br />
          Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog,<br /> The off and on
          companion of my walk;<br /> And such, at times, believing them to be,<br />
          I turned my head to look if he were there;<br /> Then into solemn
          thought I passed once more.<br /><br /> A freshness also found I at this
          time<br /> In human Life, the daily life of those<br /> Whose
          occupations really I loved;<br /> The peaceful scene oft filled me with
          surprise<br /> Changed like a garden in the heat of spring<br /> After
          an eight-days' absence. For (to omit<br /> The things which were the
          same and yet appeared<br /> Fair otherwise) amid this rural solitude,<br />
          A narrow Vale where each was known to all,<br /> 'Twas not indifferent
          to a youthful mind<br /> To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook,<br />
          Where an old man had used to sit alone,<br /> Now vacant; pale-faced
          babes whom I had left<br /> In arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet<br />
          Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down;<br /> And growing girls
          whose beauty, filched away<br /> With all its pleasant promises, was
          gone<br /> To deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.<br /><br />
          Yes, I had something of a subtler sense,<br /> And often looking round
          was moved to smiles<br /> Such as a delicate work of humour breeds;<br />
          I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,<br /> Of those
          plain-living people now observed<br /> With clearer knowledge; with
          another eye<br /> I saw the quiet woodman in the woods,<br /> The
          shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,<br /> This chiefly, did I
          note my grey-haired Dame;<br /> Saw her go forth to church or other
          work<br /> Of state, equipped in monumental trim;<br /> Short velvet
          cloak, (her bonnet of the like),<br /> A mantle such as Spanish
          Cavaliers<br /> Wore in old time. Her smooth domestic life,<br />
          Affectionate without disquietude,<br /> Her talk, her business, pleased
          me; and no less<br /> Her clear though shallow stream of piety<br />
          That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;<br /> With thoughts unfelt
          till now I saw her read<br /> Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,<br />
          And loved the book, when she had dropped asleep<br /> And made of it a
          pillow for her head.<br /><br /> Nor less do I remember to have felt,<br />
          Distinctly manifested at this time,<br /> A human-heartedness about my
          love<br /> For objects hitherto the absolute wealth<br /> Of my own
          private being and no more:<br /> Which I had loved, even as a blessed
          spirit<br /> Or Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,<br /> Might love in
          individual happiness.<br /> But now there opened on me other thoughts<br />
          Of change, congratulation or regret,<br /> A pensive feeling! It spread
          far and wide;<br /> The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,<br />
          The stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts&mdash;<br /> White
          Sirius glittering o'er the southern crags,<br /> Orion with his belt,
          and those fair Seven,<br /> Acquaintances of every little child,<br />
          And Jupiter, my own beloved star!<br /> Whatever shadings of mortality,<br />
          Whatever imports from the world of death<br /> Had come among these
          objects heretofore,<br /> Were, in the main, of mood less tender:
          strong,<br /> Deep, gloomy were they, and severe; the scatterings<br />
          Of awe or tremulous dread, that had given way<br /> In later youth to
          yearnings of a love<br /> Enthusiastic, to delight and hope.<br /><br />
          As one who hangs down-bending from the side<br /> Of a slow-moving
          boat, upon the breast<br /> Of a still water, solacing himself<br />
          With such discoveries as his eye can make<br /> Beneath him in the
          bottom of the deep,<br /> Sees many beauteous sights&mdash;weeds,
          fishes, flowers.<br /> Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies
          more,<br /> Yet often is perplexed and cannot part<br /> The shadow from
          the substance, rocks and sky,<br /> Mountains and clouds, reflected in
          the depth<br /> Of the clear flood, from things which there abide<br />
          In their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam<br /> Of his own image,
          by a sun-beam now,<br /> And wavering motions sent he knows not whence,<br />
          Impediments that make his task more sweet;<br /> Such pleasant office
          have we long pursued<br /> Incumbent o'er the surface of past time<br />
          With like success, nor often have appeared<br /> Shapes fairer or less
          doubtfully discerned<br /> Than these to which the Tale, indulgent
          Friend!<br /> Would now direct thy notice. Yet in spite<br /> Of
          pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,<br /> There was an inner
          falling off&mdash;I loved,<br /> Loved deeply all that had been loved
          before,<br /> More deeply even than ever: but a swarm<br /> Of heady
          schemes jostling each other, gawds,<br /> And feast and dance, and
          public revelry,<br /> And sports and games (too grateful in themselves,<br />
          Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe,<br /> Than as they were a
          badge glossy and fresh<br /> Of manliness and freedom) all conspired<br />
          To lure my mind from firm habitual quest<br /> Of feeding pleasures, to
          depress the zeal<br /> And damp those yearnings which had once been
          mine&mdash;<br /> A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up<br /> To his
          own eager thoughts. It would demand<br /> Some skill, and longer time
          than may be spared,<br /> To paint these vanities, and how they wrought<br />
          In haunts where they, till now, had been unknown.<br /> It seemed the
          very garments that I wore<br /> Preyed on my strength, and stopped the
          quiet stream<br /> Of self-forgetfulness.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that
          heartless chase<br /> Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange<br /> For
          books and nature at that early age.<br /> 'Tis true, some casual
          knowledge might be gained<br /> Of character or life; but at that time,<br />
          Of manners put to school I took small note,<br /> And all my deeper
          passions lay elsewhere.<br /> Far better had it been to exalt the mind<br />
          By solitary study, to uphold<br /> Intense desire through meditative
          peace;<br /> And yet, for chastisement of these regrets,<br /> The
          memory of one particular hour<br /> Doth here rise up against me. 'Mid
          a throng<br /> Of maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid,<br /> A
          medley of all tempers, I had passed<br /> The night in dancing, gaiety,
          and mirth,<br /> With din of instruments and shuffling feet,<br /> And
          glancing forms, and tapers glittering,<br /> And unaimed prattle flying
          up and down; [R]<br /> Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there<br />
          Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,<br /> Whose transient
          pleasure mounted to the head,<br /> And tingled through the veins. Ere
          we retired,<br /> The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky<br /> Was
          kindling, not unseen, from humble copse<br /> And open field, through
          which the pathway wound,<br /> And homeward led my steps. Magnificent<br />
          The morning rose, in memorable pomp,<br /> Glorious as e'er I had
          beheld&mdash;in front,<br /> The sea lay laughing at a distance; near,<br />
          The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,<br /> Grain-tinctured,
          drenched in empyrean light;<br /> And in the meadows and the lower
          grounds<br /> Was all the sweetness of a common dawn&mdash;<br /> Dews,
          vapours, and the melody of birds, [S]<br /> And labourers going forth
          to till the fields.<br /> Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brim<br />
          My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows<br /> Were then made for
          me; bond unknown to me<br /> Was given, that I should be, else sinning
          greatly,<br /> A dedicated Spirit. On I walked<br /> In thankful
          blessedness, which yet survives. [T]<br /><br /> Strange rendezvous! My
          mind was at that time<br /> A parti-coloured show of grave and gay,<br />
          Solid and light, short-sighted and profound;<br /> Of inconsiderate
          habits and sedate,<br /> Consorting in one mansion unreproved.<br /> The
          worth I knew of powers that I possessed,<br /> Though slighted and too
          oft misused. Besides,<br /> That summer, swarming as it did with
          thoughts<br /> Transient and idle, lacked not intervals<br /> When Folly
          from the frown of fleeting Time<br /> Shrunk, and the mind experienced
          in herself<br /> Conformity as just as that of old<br /> To the end and
          written spirit of God's works,<br /> Whether held forth in Nature or in
          Man,<br /> Through pregnant vision, separate or conjoined.<br /><br />
          When from our better selves we have too long<br /> Been parted by the
          hurrying world, and droop,<br /> Sick of its business, of its pleasures
          tired,<br /> How gracious, how benign, is Solitude;<br /> How potent a
          mere image of her sway;<br /> Most potent when impressed upon the mind<br />
          With an appropriate human centre&mdash;hermit,<br /> Deep in the bosom
          of the wilderness;<br /> Votary (in vast cathedral, where no foot<br />
          Is treading, where no other face is seen)<br /> Kneeling at prayers; or
          watchman on the top<br /> Of lighthouse, beaten by Atlantic waves;<br />
          Or as the soul of that great Power is met<br /> Sometimes embodied on a
          public road,<br /> When, for the night deserted, it assumes<br /> A
          character of quiet more profound<br /> Than pathless wastes.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Once, when those summer months<br /> Were flown, and autumn brought its
          annual show<br /> Of oars with oars contending, sails with sails,<br />
          Upon Winander's spacious breast, it chanced<br /> That&mdash;after I
          had left a flower-decked room<br /> (Whose in-door pastime, lighted up,
          survived<br /> To a late hour), and spirits overwrought<br /> Were
          making night do penance for a day<br /> Spent in a round of strenuous
          idleness&mdash;[U]<br /> My homeward course led up a long ascent,<br />
          Where the road's watery surface, to the top<br /> Of that sharp rising,
          glittered to the moon<br /> And bore the semblance of another stream<br />
          Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook<br /> That murmured in the
          vale. [V] All else was still;<br /> No living thing appeared in earth
          or air,<br /> And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,<br /> Sound
          there was none&mdash;but, lo! an uncouth shape,<br /> Shown by a sudden
          turning of the road,<br /> So near that, slipping back into the shade<br />
          Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,<br /> Myself unseen. He was
          of stature tall,<br /> A span above man's common measure, tall,<br />
          Stiff, lank, and upright; a more meagre man<br /> Was never seen before
          by night or day.<br /> Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth<br />
          Looked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,<br /> A mile-stone
          propped him; I could also ken<br /> That he was clothed in military
          garb,<br /> Though faded, yet entire. Companionless,<br /> No dog
          attending, by no staff sustained,<br /> He stood, and in his very dress
          appeared<br /> A desolation, a simplicity,<br /> To which the trappings
          of a gaudy world<br /> Make a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere
          long,<br /> Issued low muttered sounds, as if of pain<br /> Or some
          uneasy thought; yet still his form<br /> Kept the same awful steadiness&mdash;at
          his feet<br /> His shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blame<br /> Not
          wholly free, I watched him thus; at length<br /> Subduing my heart's
          specious cowardice,<br /> I left the shady nook where I had stood<br />
          And hailed him. Slowly from his resting-place<br /> He rose, and with a
          lean and wasted arm<br /> In measured gesture lifted to his head<br />
          Returned my salutation; then resumed<br /> His station as before; and
          when I asked<br /> His history, the veteran, in reply,<br /> Was neither
          slow nor eager; but, unmoved,<br /> And with a quiet uncomplaining
          voice,<br /> A stately air of mild indifference,<br /> He told in few
          plain words a soldier's tale&mdash;<br /> That in the Tropic Islands he
          had served,<br /> Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past:<br />
          That on his landing he had been dismissed,<br /> And now was travelling
          towards his native home.<br /> This heard, I said, in pity, "Come with
          me."<br /> He stooped, and straightway from the ground took up<br /> An
          oaken staff by me yet unobserved&mdash;<br /> A staff which must have
          dropt from his slack hand<br /> And lay till now neglected in the
          grass.<br /> Though weak his step and cautious, he appeared<br /> To
          travel without pain, and I beheld,<br /> With an astonishment but ill
          suppressed,<br /> His ghostly figure moving at my side;<br /> Nor could
          I, while we journeyed thus, forbear<br /> To turn from present
          hardships to the past,<br /> And speak of war, battle, and pestilence,<br />
          Sprinkling this talk with questions, better spared,<br /> On what he
          might himself have seen or felt.<br /> He all the while was in
          demeanour calm,<br /> Concise in answer; solemn and sublime<br /> He
          might have seemed, but that in all he said<br /> There was a strange
          half-absence, as of one<br /> Knowing too well the importance of his
          theme,<br /> But feeling it no longer. Our discourse<br /> Soon ended,
          and together on we passed<br /> In silence through a wood gloomy and
          still.<br /> Up-turning, then, along an open field,<br /> We reached a
          cottage. At the door I knocked,<br /> And earnestly to charitable care<br />
          Commended him as a poor friendless man,<br /> Belated and by sickness
          overcome.<br /> Assured that now the traveller would repose<br /> In
          comfort, I entreated that henceforth<br /> He would not linger in the
          public ways,<br /> But ask for timely furtherance and help<br /> Such as
          his state required. At this reproof,<br /> With the same ghastly
          mildness in his look,<br /> He said, "My trust is in the God of Heaven,<br />
          And in the eye of him who passes me!"<br /><br /> The cottage door was
          speedily unbarred,<br /> And now the soldier touched his hat once more<br />
          With his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,<br /> Whose tone bespake
          reviving interests<br /> Till then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned<br />
          The farewell blessing of the patient man,<br /> And so we parted. Back
          I cast a look,<br /> And lingered near the door a little space,<br />
          Then sought with quiet heart my distant home.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

      in 1160, the year of the foundation of Furness Abbey. It is no longer
      "snow-white," a so-called Restoration having taken place within recent
      years, on architectural principles. The plaster is stripped from the

        better harmonize with the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake country.".

      village to Colthouse, on the opposite side of the Vale, and lived there
      for some time before her death. Along with Dr. Cradock I examined the
      Parish Registers of Hawkshead in the autumn of 1882, and we found the
      following entry belonging to the year 1796. </span>

        "Anne Tyson of Colthouse, widow, died May 25th buried 28th, in

    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">Her removal to Colthouse is confirmed, in a
      curious way, by a reminiscence of William Wordsworth's (the poet's son),
      who told me that if asked where the dame's house was, he would have
      pointed to a spot on the eastern side of the valley, and out of the
      village altogether; his father having taken him from Rydal Mount to
      Hawkshead when a mere boy, and pointed out that spot. Doubtless Wordsworth
      took his son to the cottage at Colthouse, where Anne Tyson died, as the
      earlier abode in Hawkshead village is well known, and its site is
      indisputable.&mdash;Ed.</span><br /> <a href="#fr24b4H">return</a><br />

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Persons have visited the cottage," wrote Dr. Cradock, "without
        discovering it; and yet it is not forty yards distant, and is still
        exactly as described. On the opposite side of the lane leading to the
        cottage, and a few steps above it, is a narrow passage through some new
        stone buildings. On emerging from this, you meet a small garden, the
        farther side of which is bounded by the brook, confined on both sides by
        larger flags, and also covered by flags of the same Coniston formation,
        through the interstices of which you may see and hear the stream running
        freely. The upper flags are now used as a footpath, and lead by another
        passage back into the village. No doubt the garden has been reduced in
        size, by the use of that part of it fronting the lane for building
        purposes. The stream, before it enters the area of buildings and
        gardens, is open by the lane side, and seemingly comes from the hills to
        the westwards. The large flags are extremely hard and durable, and it is
        probably that the very flags which paved the channel in Wordsworth's
        time may still be doing the same duty."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">The house adjoining this garden was not Dame
      Tyson's but a Mr. Watson's. Possibly, however, some of the boys had free
      access to the latter, so that Wordsworth could speak of it as "our
      garden;" or, Dame Tyson may have rented it. See <a href="#section30">Note

    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">This is doubtless the streamlet called Town
      Beck; and it is perhaps the most interesting of all the spots alluded to
      by Wordsworth which can be traced out in the Hawkshead district, I am
      indebted to Mr. Rawnsley for the following note:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "From the village, nay, from the poet's very door when he lived at Anne
        Tyson's, a good path leads on, past the vicarage, quite to its upland
        place of birth. It has eaten its way deeply into the soil; in one place
        there is a series of still pools, that overflow and fall into others,
        with quiet sound; at other spots, it is bustling and busy. Fine timber
        is found on either side of it, the roots of the trees often laid bare by
        the passing current. In one or two places by the side of this beck, and
        beneath the shadow of lofty oaks, may be found boulder stones, grey and
        moss-covered. Birds make hiding-places for themselves in these oak and
        hazel bushes by the stream. Following it up, we find it receives, at a
        tiny ford, the tribute of another stream from the north-west, and comes
        down between the adjacent hills (well wooded to the summit) from meadows
        of short-cropped grass, and to these from the open moorland, where it
        takes its rise. Every conceivable variety of beauty of sound and sight
        in streamlet life is found as we follow the course of this Town Beck. We
        owe much of Wordsworth's intimate acquaintance with streamlet beauty to
        it."

      right front of the cottage, where an outhouse is now built. If this be so,
      Wordsworth's bedroom must have been that on the proper left, with the
      smaller of the two windows. The cottage faces nearly south-west. In the
      upper flat there are two bedrooms to the front, with oak flooring, one of
      which must have been Wordsworth's. See <a href="#section30">Note II.</a>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "All that can be safely said as to the course of that memorable morning
        walk is that, in that neighbourhood, a view of the sea can only be
        obtained at a considerable elevation; also that if the words 'in <i>front</i>
        the sea lay laughing' are to be taken as rigidly exact, the poet's
        progress towards Hawkshead must have been in a direction mainly
        southerly, and therefore from the country north of that place. These and
        all other conditions of the description are answered in several parts of
        the range of hills lying between Elterwater and Hawkshead."

          When Contemplation, like the night-calm felt<br /> Through earth and
          sky, spreads widely, and sends deep<br /> Into the soul its
          tranquillising power,<br /> Even then I sometimes grieve for thee, O
          Man,<br /> Earth's paramount Creature! not so much for woes<br /> That
          thou endurest; heavy though that weight be,<br /> Cloud-like it mounts,
          or touched with light divine<br /> Doth melt away; but for those palms
          achieved,<br /> Through length of time, by patient exercise<br /> Of
          study and hard thought; there, there, it is<br /> That sadness finds
          its fuel. Hitherto,<br /> In progress through this Verse, my mind hath
          looked<br /> Upon the speaking face of earth and heaven<br /> As her
          prime teacher, intercourse with man<br /> Established by the sovereign
          Intellect,<br /> Who through that bodily image hath diffused,<br /> As
          might appear to the eye of fleeting time,<br /> A deathless spirit.
          Thou also, man! hast wrought,<br /> For commerce of thy nature with
          herself,<br /> Things that aspire to unconquerable life;<br /> And yet
          we feel&mdash;we cannot choose but feel&mdash;<br /> That they must
          perish. Tremblings of the heart<br /> It gives, to think that our
          immortal being<br /> No more shall need such garments; and yet man,<br />
          As long as he shall be the child of earth,<br /> Might almost "weep to
          have" what he may lose,<br /> Nor be himself extinguished, but survive,<br />
          Abject, depressed, forlorn, disconsolate.<br /> A thought is with me
          sometimes, and I say,&mdash;<br /> Should the whole frame of earth by
          inward throes<br /> Be wrenched, or fire come down from far to scorch<br />
          Her pleasant habitations, and dry up<br /> Old Ocean, in his bed left
          singed and bare,<br /> Yet would the living Presence still subsist<br />
          Victorious, and composure would ensue,<br /> And kindlings like the
          morning&mdash;presage sure<br /> Of day returning and of life revived.<br />
          But all the meditations of mankind,<br /> Yea, all the adamantine holds
          of truth<br /> By reason built, or passion, which itself<br /> Is
          highest reason in a soul sublime;<br /> The consecrated works of Bard
          and Sage,<br /> Sensuous or intellectual, wrought by men,<br /> Twin
          labourers and heirs of the same hopes;<br /> Where would they be? Oh!
          why hath not the Mind<br /> Some element to stamp her image on<br /> In
          nature somewhat nearer to her own?<br /> Why, gifted with such powers
          to send abroad<br /> Her spirit, must it lodge in shrines so frail?<br /><br />
          One day, when from my lips a like complaint<br /> Had fallen in
          presence of a studious friend,<br /> He with a smile made answer, that
          in truth<br /> 'Twas going far to seek disquietude;<br /> But on the
          front of his reproof confessed<br /> That he himself had oftentimes
          given way<br /> To kindred hauntings. Whereupon I told,<br /> That once
          in the stillness of a summer's noon,<br /> While I was seated in a
          rocky cave<br /> By the sea-side, perusing, so it chanced,<br /> The
          famous history of the errant knight<br /> Recorded by Cervantes, these
          same thoughts<br /> Beset me, and to height unusual rose,<br /> While
          listlessly I sate, and, having closed<br /> The book, had turned my
          eyes toward the wide sea.<br /> On poetry and geometric truth,<br /> And
          their high privilege of lasting life,<br /> From all internal injury
          exempt,<br /> I mused, upon these chiefly: and at length,<br /> My
          senses yielding to the sultry air,<br /> Sleep seized me, and I passed
          into a dream.<br /> I saw before me stretched a boundless plain<br /> Of
          sandy wilderness, all black and void,<br /> And as I looked around,
          distress and fear<br /> Came creeping over me, when at my side,<br />
          Close at my side, an uncouth shape appeared<br /> Upon a dromedary,
          mounted high.<br /> He seemed an Arab of the Bedouin tribes:<br /> A
          lance he bore, and underneath one arm<br /> A stone, and in the
          opposite hand a shell<br /> Of a surpassing brightness. At the sight<br />
          Much I rejoiced, not doubting but a guide<br /> Was present, one who
          with unerring skill<br /> Would through the desert lead me; and while
          yet<br /> I looked and looked, self-questioned what this freight<br />
          Which the new-comer carried through the waste<br /> Could mean, the
          Arab told me that the stone<br /> (To give it in the language of the
          dream)<br /> Was "Euclid's Elements;" and "This," said he,<br /> "Is
          something of more worth;" and at the word<br /> Stretched forth the
          shell, so beautiful in shape,<br /> In colour so resplendent, with
          command<br /> That I should hold it to my ear. I did so,<br /> And heard
          that instant in an unknown tongue,<br /> Which yet I understood,
          articulate sounds,<br /> A loud prophetic blast of harmony;<br /> An
          Ode, in passion uttered, which foretold<br /> Destruction to the
          children of the earth<br /> By deluge, now at hand. No sooner ceased<br />
          The song, than the Arab with calm look declared<br /> That all would
          come to pass of which the voice<br /> Had given forewarning, and that
          he himself<br /> Was going then to bury those two books:<br /> The one
          that held acquaintance with the stars,<br /> And wedded soul to soul in
          purest bond<br /> Of reason, undisturbed by space or time;<br /> The
          other that was a god, yea many gods,<br /> Had voices more than all the
          winds, with power<br /> To exhilarate the spirit, and to soothe,<br />
          Through every clime, the heart of human kind.<br /> While this was
          uttering, strange as it may seem,<br /> I wondered not, although I
          plainly saw<br /> The one to be a stone, the other a shell;<br /> Nor
          doubted once but that they both were books,<br /> Having a perfect
          faith in all that passed.<br /> Far stronger, now, grew the desire I
          felt<br /> To cleave unto this man; but when I prayed<br /> To share his
          enterprise, he hurried on<br /> Reckless of me: I followed, not unseen,<br />
          For oftentimes he cast a backward look,<br /> Grasping his twofold
          treasure.&mdash;Lance in rest,<br /> He rode, I keeping pace with him;
          and now<br /> He, to my fancy, had become the knight<br /> Whose tale
          Cervantes tells; yet not the knight,<br /> But was an Arab of the
          desert too;<br /> Of these was neither, and was both at once.<br /> His
          countenance, meanwhile, grew more disturbed;<br /> And, looking
          backwards when he looked, mine eyes<br /> Saw, over half the wilderness
          diffused,<br /> A bed of glittering light: I asked the cause:<br /> "It
          is," said he, "the waters of the deep<br /> Gathering upon us;"
          quickening then the pace<br /> Of the unwieldy creature he bestrode,<br />
          He left me: I called after him aloud;<br /> He heeded not; but, with
          his twofold charge<br /> Still in his grasp, before me, full in view,<br />
          Went hurrying o'er the illimitable waste,<br /> With the fleet waters
          of a drowning world<br /> In chase of him; whereat I waked in terror,<br />
          And saw the sea before me, and the book,<br /> In which I had been
          reading, at my side.<br /><br /> Full often, taking from the world of
          sleep<br /> This Arab phantom, which I thus beheld,<br /> This
          semi-Quixote, I to him have given<br /> A substance, fancied him a
          living man,<br /> A gentle dweller in the desert, crazed<br /> By love
          and feeling, and internal thought<br /> Protracted among endless
          solitudes;<br /> Have shaped him wandering upon this quest!<br /> Nor
          have I pitied him; but rather felt<br /> Reverence was due to a being
          thus employed;<br /> And thought that, in the blind and awful lair<br />
          Of such a madness, reason did lie couched.<br /> Enow there are on
          earth to take in charge<br /> Their wives, their children, and their
          virgin loves,<br /> Or whatsoever else the heart holds dear;<br /> Enow
          to stir for these; yea, will I say,<br /> Contemplating in soberness
          the approach<br /> Of an event so dire, by signs in earth<br /> Or
          heaven made manifest, that I could share<br /> That maniac's fond
          anxiety, and go<br /> Upon like errand. Oftentimes at least<br /> Me
          hath such strong enhancement overcome,<br /> When I have held a volume
          in my hand,<br /> Poor earthly casket of immortal verse,<br />
          Shakespeare, or Milton, labourers divine!<br /><br /> Great and benign,
          indeed, must be the power<br /> Of living nature, which could thus so
          long<br /> Detain me from the best of other guides<br /> And dearest
          helpers, left unthanked, unpraised,<br /> Even in the time of lisping
          infancy;<br /> And later down, in prattling childhood even,<br /> While
          I was travelling back among those days,<br /> How could I ever play an
          ingrate's part?<br /> Once more should I have made those bowers
          resound,<br /> By intermingling strains of thankfulness<br /> With their
          own thoughtless melodies; at least<br /> It might have well beseemed me
          to repeat<br /> Some simply fashioned tale, to tell again,<br /> In
          slender accents of sweet verse, some tale<br /> That did bewitch me
          then, and soothes me now.<br /> O Friend! O Poet! brother of my soul,<br />
          Think not that I could pass along untouched<br /> By these
          remembrances. Yet wherefore speak?<br /> Why call upon a few weak words
          to say<br /> What is already written in the hearts<br /> Of all that
          breathe?&mdash;what in the path of all<br /> Drops daily from the
          tongue of every child,<br /> Wherever man is found? The trickling tear<br />
          Upon the cheek of listening Infancy<br /> Proclaims it, and the
          insuperable look<br /> That drinks as if it never could be full.<br /><br />
          That portion of my story I shall leave<br /> There registered: whatever
          else of power<br /> Or pleasure sown, or fostered thus, may be<br />
          Peculiar to myself, let that remain<br /> Where still it works, though
          hidden from all search<br /> Among the depths of time. Yet is it just<br />
          That here, in memory of all books which lay<br /> Their sure
          foundations in the heart of man,<br /> Whether by native prose, or
          numerous verse,<br /> That in the name of all inspir&egrave;d souls&mdash;<br />
          From Homer the great Thunderer, from the voice<br /> That roars along
          the bed of Jewish song,<br /> And that more varied and elaborate,<br />
          Those trumpet-tones of harmony that shake<br /> Our shores in England,&mdash;from
          those loftiest notes<br /> Down to the low and wren-like warblings,
          made<br /> For cottagers and spinners at the wheel,<br /> And sun-burnt
          travellers resting their tired limbs,<br /> Stretched under wayside
          hedge-rows, ballad tunes,<br /> Food for the hungry ears of little
          ones,<br /> And of old men who have survived their joys&mdash;<br />
          'Tis just that in behalf of these, the works,<br /> And of the men that
          framed them, whether known,<br /> Or sleeping nameless in their
          scattered graves,<br /> That I should here assert their rights, attest<br />
          Their honours, and should, once for all, pronounce<br /> Their
          benediction; speak of them as Powers<br /> For ever to be hallowed;
          only less,<br /> For what we are and what we may become,<br /> Than
          Nature's self, which is the breath of God,<br /> Or His pure Word by
          miracle revealed.<br /><br /> Rarely and with reluctance would I stoop<br />
          To transitory themes; yet I rejoice,<br /> And, by these thoughts
          admonished, will pour out<br /> Thanks with uplifted heart, that I was
          reared<br /> Safe from an evil which these days have laid<br /> Upon the
          children of the land, a pest<br /> That might have dried me up, body
          and soul.<br /> This verse is dedicate to Nature's self,<br /> And
          things that teach as Nature teaches: then,<br /> Oh! where had been the
          Man, the Poet where,<br /> Where had we been, we two, beloved Friend!<br />
          If in the season of unperilous choice,<br /> In lieu of wandering, as
          we did, through vales<br /> Rich with indigenous produce, open ground<br />
          Of Fancy, happy pastures ranged at will,<br /> We had been followed,
          hourly watched, and noosed,<br /> Each in his several melancholy walk<br />
          Stringed like a poor man's heifer at its feed,<br /> Led through the
          lanes in forlorn servitude;<br /> Or rather like a stalled ox debarred<br />
          From touch of growing grass, that may not taste<br /> A flower till it
          have yielded up its sweets<br /> A prelibation to the mower's scythe.<br /><br />
          Behold the parent hen amid her brood,<br /> Though fledged and
          feathered, and well pleased to part<br /> And straggle from her
          presence, still a brood,<br /> And she herself from the maternal bond<br />
          Still undischarged; yet doth she little more<br /> Than move with them
          in tenderness and love,<br /> A centre to the circle which they make;<br />
          And now and then, alike from need of theirs<br /> And call of her own
          natural appetites,<br /> She scratches, ransacks up the earth for food,<br />
          Which they partake at pleasure. Early died<br /> My honoured Mother,
          she who was the heart<br /> And hinge of all our learnings and our
          loves:<br /> She left us destitute, and, as we might,<br /> Trooping
          together. Little suits it me<br /> To break upon the sabbath of her
          rest<br /> With any thought that looks at others' blame;<br /> Nor would
          I praise her but in perfect love.<br /> Hence am I checked: but let me
          boldly say,<br /> In gratitude, and for the sake of truth,<br /> Unheard
          by her, that she, not falsely taught,<br /> Fetching her goodness
          rather from times past,<br /> Than shaping novelties for times to come,<br />
          Had no presumption, no such jealousy,<br /> Nor did by habit of her
          thoughts mistrust<br /> Our nature, but had virtual faith that He<br />
          Who fills the mother's breast with innocent milk,<br /> Doth also for
          our nobler part provide,<br /> Under His great correction and control,<br />
          As innocent instincts, and as innocent food;<br /> Or draws for minds
          that are left free to trust<br /> In the simplicities of opening life<br />
          Sweet honey out of spurned or dreaded weeds.<br /> This was her creed,
          and therefore she was pure<br /> From anxious fear of error or mishap,<br />
          And evil, overweeningly so called;<br /> Was not puffed up by false
          unnatural hopes,<br /> Nor selfish with unnecessary cares,<br /> Nor
          with impatience from the season asked<br /> More than its timely
          produce; rather loved<br /> The hours for what they are, than from
          regard<br /> Glanced on their promises in restless pride.<br /> Such was
          she&mdash;not from faculties more strong<br /> Than others have, but
          from the times, perhaps,<br /> And spot in which she lived, and through
          a grace<br /> Of modest meekness, simple-mindedness,<br /> A heart that
          found benignity and hope,<br /> Being itself benign.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My drift I
          fear<br /> Is scarcely obvious; but, that common sense<br /> May try
          this modern system by its fruits,<br /> Leave let me take to place
          before her sight<br /> A specimen pourtrayed with faithful hand.<br />
          Full early trained to worship seemliness,<br /> This model of a child
          is never known<br /> To mix in quarrels; that were far beneath<br /> Its
          dignity; with gifts he bubbles o'er<br /> As generous as a fountain;
          selfishness<br /> May not come near him, nor the little throng<br /> Of
          flitting pleasures tempt him from his path;<br /> The wandering beggars
          propagate his name,<br /> Dumb creatures find him tender as a nun,<br />
          And natural or supernatural fear,<br /> Unless it leap upon him in a
          dream,<br /> Touches him not. To enhance the wonder, see<br /> How arch
          his notices, how nice his sense<br /> Of the ridiculous; not blind is
          he<br /> To the broad follies of the licensed world,<br /> Yet innocent
          himself withal, though shrewd,<br /> And can read lectures upon
          innocence;<br /> A miracle of scientific lore,<br /> Ships he can guide
          across the pathless sea,<br /> And tell you all their cunning; he can
          read<br /> The inside of the earth, and spell the stars;<br /> He knows
          the policies of foreign lands;<br /> Can string you names of districts,
          cities, towns,<br /> The whole world over, tight as beads of dew<br />
          Upon a gossamer thread; he sifts, he weighs;<br /> All things are put
          to question; he must live<br /> Knowing that he grows wiser every day<br />
          Or else not live at all, and seeing too<br /> Each little drop of
          wisdom as it falls<br /> Into the dimpling cistern of his heart:<br />
          For this unnatural growth the trainer blame,<br /> Pity the tree.&mdash;Poor
          human vanity,<br /> Wert thou extinguished, little would be left<br />
          Which he could truly love; but how escape?<br /> For, ever as a thought
          of purer, birth<br /> Rises to lead him toward a better clime,<br />
          Some intermeddler still is on the watch<br /> To drive him back, and
          pound him, like a stray,<br /> Within the pinfold of his own conceit.<br />
          Meanwhile old grandame earth is grieved to find<br /> The playthings,
          which her love designed for him,<br /> Unthought of: in their woodland
          beds the flowers<br /> Weep, and the river sides are all forlorn.<br />
          Oh! give us once again the wishing cap<br /> Of Fortunatus, and the
          invisible coat<br /> Of Jack the Giant-killer, Robin Hood,<br /> And
          Sabra in the forest with St. George!<br /> The child, whose love is
          here, at least, doth reap<br /> One precious gain, that he forgets
          himself.<br /><br /> These mighty workmen of our later age,<br /> Who,
          with a broad highway, have overbridged<br /> The froward chaos of
          futurity,<br /> Tamed to their bidding; they who have the skill<br /> To
          manage books, and things, and make them act<br /> On infant minds as
          surely as the sun<br /> Deals with a flower; the keepers of our time,<br />
          The guides and wardens of our faculties,<br /> Sages who in their
          prescience would control<br /> All accidents, and to the very road<br />
          Which they have fashioned would confine us down,<br /> Like engines;
          when will their presumption learn,<br /> That in the unreasoning
          progress of the world<br /> A wiser spirit is at work for us,<br /> A
          better eye than theirs, most prodigal<br /> Of blessings, and most
          studious of our good,<br /> Even in what seem our most unfruitful
          hours?<br /><br /> There was a Boy: ye knew him well, ye cliffs<br /> And
          islands of Winander!&mdash;many a time<br /> At evening, when the
          earliest stars began<br /> To move along the edges of the hills,<br />
          Rising or setting, would he stand alone<br /> Beneath the trees or by
          the glimmering lake,<br /> And there, with fingers interwoven, both
          hands<br /> Pressed closely palm to palm, and to his mouth<br />
          Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,<br /> Blew mimic hootings to
          the silent owls,<br /> That they might answer him; and they would shout<br />
          Across the watery vale, and shout again,<br /> Responsive to his call,
          with quivering peals,<br /> And long halloos and screams, and echoes
          loud,<br /> Redoubled and redoubled, concourse wild<br /> Of jocund din;
          and, when a lengthened pause<br /> Of silence came and baffled his best
          skill,<br /> Then sometimes, in that silence while he hung<br />
          Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise<br /> Has carried far into
          his heart the voice<br /> Of mountain torrents; or the visible scene<br />
          Would enter unawares into his mind,<br /> With all its solemn imagery,
          its rocks,<br /> Its woods, and that uncertain heaven, received<br />
          Into the bosom of the steady lake.<br /><br /> This Boy was taken from
          his mates, and died<br /> In childhood, ere he was full twelve years
          old.<br /> Fair is the spot, most beautiful the vale<br /> Where he was
          born; the grassy churchyard hangs<br /> Upon a slope above the village
          school,<br /> And through that churchyard when my way has led<br /> On
          summer evenings, I believe that there<br /> A long half hour together I
          have stood<br /> Mute, looking at the grave in which he lies!<br /> Even
          now appears before the mind's clear eye<br /> That self-same village
          church; I see her sit<br /> (The thron&egrave;d Lady whom erewhile we
          hailed)<br /> On her green hill, forgetful of this Boy<br /> Who
          slumbers at her feet,&mdash;forgetful, too,<br /> Of all her silent
          neighbourhood of graves,<br /> And listening only to the gladsome
          sounds<br /> That, from the rural school ascending, play<br /> Beneath
          her and about her. May she long<br /> Behold a race of young ones like
          to those<br /> With whom I herded!&mdash;(easily, indeed,<br /> We might
          have fed upon a fatter soil<br /> Of arts and letters&mdash;but be that
          forgiven)&mdash;<br /> A race of real children; not too wise,<br /> Too
          learned, or too good; but wanton, fresh,<br /> And bandied up and down
          by love and hate;<br /> Not unresentful where self-justified;<br />
          Fierce, moody, patient, venturous, modest, shy;<br /> Mad at their
          sports like withered leaves in winds;<br /> Though doing wrong and
          suffering, and full oft<br /> Bending beneath our life's mysterious
          weight<br /> Of pain, and doubt, and fear, yet yielding not<br /> In
          happiness to the happiest upon earth.<br /> Simplicity in habit, truth
          in speech,<br /> Be these the daily strengtheners of their minds;<br />
          May books and Nature be their early joy!<br /> And knowledge, rightly
          honoured with that name&mdash;<br /> Knowledge not purchased by the
          loss of power!<br /><br /> Well do I call to mind the very week<br />
          When I was first intrusted to the care<br /> Of that sweet Valley; when
          its paths, its shores,<br /> And brooks were like a dream of novelty<br />
          To my half-infant thoughts; that very week,<br /> While I was roving up
          and down alone,<br /> Seeking I knew not what, I chanced to cross<br />
          One of those open fields, which, shaped like ears,<br /> Make green
          peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake:<br /> Twilight was coming on, yet
          through the gloom<br /> Appeared distinctly on the opposite shore<br />
          A heap of garments, as if left by one<br /> Who might have there been
          bathing. Long I watched,<br /> But no one owned them; meanwhile the
          calm lake<br /> Grew dark with all the shadows on its breast,<br /> And,
          now and then, a fish up-leaping snapped<br /> The breathless stillness.
          The succeeding day,<br /> Those unclaimed garments telling a plain tale<br />
          Drew to the spot an anxious crowd; some looked<br /> In passive
          expectation from the shore,<br /> While from a boat others hung o'er
          the deep,<br /> Sounding with grappling irons and long poles.<br /> At
          last, the dead man, 'mid that beauteous scene<br /> Of trees and hills
          and water, bolt upright<br /> Rose, with his ghastly face, a spectre
          shape<br /> Of terror; yet no soul-debasing fear,<br /> Young as I was,
          a child not nine years old,<br /> Possessed me, for my inner eye had
          seen<br /> Such sights before, among the shining streams<br /> Of fa&euml;ry
          land, the forest of romance.<br /> Their spirit hallowed the sad
          spectacle<br /> With decoration of ideal grace;<br /> A dignity, a
          smoothness, like the works<br /> Of Grecian art, and purest poesy.<br /><br />
          A precious treasure had I long possessed,<br /> A little yellow,
          canvas-covered book,<br /> A slender abstract of the Arabian tales;<br />
          And, from companions in a new abode,<br /> When first I learnt, that
          this dear prize of mine<br /> Was but a block hewn from a mighty quarry&mdash;<br />
          That there were four large volumes, laden all<br /> With kindred
          matter, 'twas to me, in truth,<br /> A promise scarcely earthly.
          Instantly,<br /> With one not richer than myself, I made<br /> A
          covenant that each should lay aside<br /> The moneys he possessed, and
          hoard up more,<br /> Till our joint savings had amassed enough<br /> To
          make this book our own. Through several months,<br /> In spite of all
          temptation, we preserved<br /> Religiously that vow; but firmness
          failed,<br /> Nor were we ever masters of our wish.<br /><br /> And when
          thereafter to my father's house<br /> The holidays returned me, there
          to find<br /> That golden store of books which I had left,<br /> What
          joy was mine! How often in the course<br /> Of those glad respites,
          though a soft west wind<br /> Ruffled the waters to the angler's wish<br />
          For a whole day together, have I lain<br /> Down by thy side, O
          Derwent! murmuring stream,<br /> On the hot stones, and in the glaring
          sun,<br /> And there have read, devouring as I read,<br /> Defrauding
          the day's glory, desperate!<br /> Till with a sudden bound of smart
          reproach,<br /> Such as an idler deals with in his shame,<br /> I to the
          sport betook myself again.<br /><br /> A gracious spirit o'er this earth
          presides,<br /> And o'er the heart of man: invisibly<br /> It comes, to
          works of unreproved delight,<br /> And tendency benign, directing those<br />
          Who care not, know not, think not what they do.<br /> The tales that
          charm away the wakeful night<br /> In Araby, romances; legends penned<br />
          For solace by dim light of monkish lamps;<br /> Fictions, for ladies of
          their love, devised<br /> By youthful squires; adventures endless, spun<br />
          By the dismantled warrior in old age,<br /> Out of the bowels of those
          very schemes<br /> In which his youth did first extravagate;<br /> These
          spread like day, and something in the shape<br /> Of these will live
          till man shall be no more.<br /> Dumb yearnings, hidden appetites, are
          ours,<br /> And <i>they must</i> have their food. Our childhood sits,<br />
          Our simple childhood, sits upon a throne<br /> That hath more power
          than all the elements.<br /> I guess not what this tells of Being past,<br />
          Nor what it augurs of the life to come;<br /> But so it is, and, in
          that dubious hour,<br /> That twilight when we first begin to see<br />
          This dawning earth, to recognise, expect,<br /> And in the long
          probation that ensues,<br /> The time of trial, ere we learn to live<br />
          In reconcilement with our stinted powers;<br /> To endure this state of
          meagre vassalage,<br /> Unwilling to forego, confess, submit,<br />
          Uneasy and unsettled, yoke-fellows<br /> To custom, mettlesome, and not
          yet tamed<br /> And humbled down; oh! then we feel, we feel,<br /> We
          know where we have friends. Ye dreamers, then,<br /> Forgers of daring
          tales! we bless you then,<br /> Impostors, drivellers, dotards, as the
          ape<br /> Philosophy will call you: <i>then</i> we feel<br /> With what,
          and how great might ye are in league,<br /> Who make our wish, our
          power, our thought a deed,<br /> An empire, a possession,&mdash;ye whom
          time<br /> And seasons serve; all Faculties to whom<br /> Earth
          crouches, the elements are potter's clay,<br /> Space like a heaven
          filled up with northern lights,<br /> Here, nowhere, there, and
          everywhere at once.<br /><br /> Relinquishing this lofty eminence<br />
          For ground, though humbler, not the less a tract<br /> Of the same
          isthmus, which our spirits cross<br /> In progress from their native
          continent<br /> To earth and human life, the Song might dwell<br /> On
          that delightful time of growing youth,<br /> When craving for the
          marvellous gives way<br /> To strengthening love for things that we
          have seen;<br /> When sober truth and steady sympathies,<br /> Offered
          to notice by less daring pens,<br /> Take firmer hold of us, and words
          themselves<br /> Move us with conscious pleasure.<br /><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sad<br />
          At thought of raptures now for ever flown;<br /> Almost to tears I
          sometimes could be sad<br /> To think of, to read over, many a page,<br />
          Poems withal of name, which at that time<br /> Did never fail to
          entrance me, and are now<br /> Dead in my eyes, dead as a theatre<br />
          Fresh emptied of spectators. Twice five years<br /> Or less I might
          have seen, when first my mind<br /> With conscious pleasure opened to
          the charm<br /> Of words in tuneful order, found them sweet<br /> For
          their own <i>sakes</i>, a passion, and a power;<br /> And phrases
          pleased me chosen for delight,<br /> For pomp, or love. Oft, in the
          public roads<br /> Yet unfrequented, while the morning light<br /> Was
          yellowing the hill tops, I went abroad<br /> With a dear friend, and
          for the better part<br /> Of two delightful hours we strolled along<br />
          By the still borders of the misty lake,<br /> Repeating favourite
          verses with one voice,<br /> Or conning more, as happy as the birds<br />
          That round us chaunted. Well might we be glad,<br /> Lifted above the
          ground by airy fancies,<br /> More bright than madness or the dreams of
          wine;<br /> And, though full oft the objects of our love<br /> Were
          false, and in their splendour overwrought,<br /> Yet was there surely
          then no vulgar power<br /> Working within us,&mdash;nothing less, in
          truth,<br /> Than that most noble attribute of man,<br /> Though yet
          untutored and inordinate,<br /> That wish for something loftier, more
          adorned,<br /> Than is the common aspect, daily garb,<br /> Of human
          life. What wonder, then, if sounds<br /> Of exultation echoed through
          the groves!<br /> For, images, and sentiments, and words,<br /> And
          everything encountered or pursued<br /> In that delicious world of
          poesy,<br /> Kept holiday, a never-ending show,<br /> With music,
          incense, festival, and flowers!<br /><br /> Here must we pause: this
          only let me add,<br /> From heart-experience, and in humblest sense<br />
          Of modesty, that he, who in his youth<br /> A daily wanderer among
          woods and fields<br /> With living Nature hath been intimate,<br /> Not
          only in that raw unpractised time<br /> Is stirred to extasy, as others
          are,<br /> By glittering verse; but further, doth receive,<br /> In
          measure only dealt out to himself,<br /> Knowledge and increase of
          enduring joy<br /> From the great Nature that exists in works<br /> Of
          mighty Poets. Visionary power<br /> Attends the motions of the viewless
          winds,<br /> Embodied in the mystery of words:<br /> There, darkness
          makes abode, and all the host<br /> Of shadowy things work endless
          changes,&mdash;there,<br /> As in a mansion like their proper home,<br />
          Even forms and substances are circumfused<br /> By that transparent
          veil with light divine,<br /> And, through the turnings intricate of
          verse,<br /> Present themselves as objects recognised,<br /> In flashes,
          and with glory not their own.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="#Ctoc">Contents&mdash;<i>The

        has given us not only a most poetical insight into the real nature of
        the 'Illustrious Hidalgo of La Mancha'; he has shown us that it was a
        nature compacted of the madman and the poet, and this in language so
        appropriate, that the consideration of it cannot fail to give pleasure
        to all who have found a reason for weighing Wordsworth's words.<br />

      <p>
        Here we have the plains of Montiel, and the poet realising all that Don

        first set out on his quest and met with nothing worth recording.

        This is absolutely true, and was one of the earliest complaints made a
        century and a half ago, when Spaniards began to criticise their one

      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Here again is a most profound description of the creation of Cervantes.
        Don Quixote was mad, but his was a madness that proceeded from that
        'blind and awful lair,' a disordered stomach, rather than from an
        injured brain. Had Don Quixote not forsaken the exercise of the chase
        and early rising, if he had not taken to eating chestnuts at night, cold
        spiced meat, together with onions and 'ollas podridas', then proceeding
        to read exciting, unnatural tales of love and war, he would not have
        gone mad.<br /> <br /> "But his reason only lay 'couched,' not overthrown.
        Only give him a dose of the balsam of Fierabras, his reason shall spring
        out of its lair, like a lion from out its hiding-place, as indeed it
        did; and you then have that wonderful piece of rhetoric, which describes
        the army of Alifanfaron in the eighteenth chapter, Part I.<br /> <br />
        "There are many other things worthy of note, such as
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'crazed<br /> By love and feeling, and internal thought<br /> Protracted
          among endless solitudes,'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        all of which are 'fit epithets blessed in the marriage of pure words,'
        which the author of <i>The Prelude</i>, without any special learning, or
        personal knowledge of Spain, has given us, and are so striking as to
        compel us once again to go to Wordsworth and say, 'we do not all
        understand thee yet, not all that thou hast given us.'<br /> <br /> Very
        truly yours, A. J. Duffield."

      &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;">Wordsworth's earliest teachers, before
      he was sent to Hawkshead School, were his mother and the Rev. Mr. Gilbanks
      at Cockermouth, and Mrs. Anne Birkett at Penrith. His mother and Dame
      Birkett taught him to read, and trained his infant memory. Mr. Gilbanks
      also gave him elementary instruction; while his father made him commit to
      memory portions of the English poets. At Hawkshead he read English
      literature, learned Latin and Mathematics, and wrote both English and
      Latin verse. There was little or no method, and no mechanical or
      artificial drill in his early education. Though he was taught both
      languages and mathematics he was left as free to range the "happy
      pastures" of literature, as to range the Hawkshead woods on autumn nights
      in pursuit of woodcocks. It is likely that the reference in the above
      passage is to his education both in childhood and in youth, although
      specially to the former. In his <i>Autobiographical Memoranda</i>,
      Wordsworth says, </span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Of my earliest days at School I have little to say, but that they were
        very happy ones, chiefly because I was left at liberty, then and in the
        vacations, to read whatever books I liked. For example, I read all
        Fielding's works, <i>Don Quixote, Gil Blas</i>, and any part of Swift
        that I liked; <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> and the <i>Tale of a Tub</i>
        being both much to my taste."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">As Wordsworth alludes to Coleridge's
      education, along with his own, "in the season of unperilous choice," the

      &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;">Hawkshead School, in which Wordsworth
      was taught for eight years&mdash;from 1778 to 1786&mdash;was founded by
      Archbishop Sandys of York, in 1585, and the building is still very much as
      it was in Wordsworth's time. The main school-room is on the ground floor.
      One small chamber on the first floor was used, in the end of last century,
      by the head master, as a private class-room, for teaching a few advanced
      pupils. In another is a small library, formed in part by the donations of
      the scholars; it having been a custom for each pupil to present a volume
      on leaving the school, or to send one afterwards. Very probably one of the
      volumes now in the library was presented by Wordsworth. There are several
      which were presented by his school-fellows, during the years in which
      Wordsworth was at Hawkshead. The master, in 1877, promised me that he
      would search through his somewhat musty treasures, to see if he could
      discover a book with the poet's autograph; but I never heard of his
      success. On the wall of the room containing the library is a tablet,
      recording the names of several masters. There also, in an old oak chest,
      is kept the original charter of the school. The oak benches downstairs are
      covered with the names or initials of the boys, deeply cut; and, amongst
      them, the name of William Wordsworth&mdash;but not those of his brothers
      Richard, John, or Christopher&mdash;may be seen. For further details as to
      the Hawkshead School, see the <i>Life</i> of the Poet in this edition.
      Towards the close of last century, when Wordsworth and his three brothers
      were educated there, the school was one of the best educational
      institutions in the north of England.&mdash;Ed.</span><br /> <a

          The leaves were fading when to Esthwaite's banks<br /> And the
          simplicities of cottage life<br /> I bade farewell; and, one among the
          youth<br /> Who, summoned by that season, reunite<br /> As scattered
          birds troop to the fowler's lure,<br /> Went back to Granta's
          cloisters, not so prompt<br /> Or eager, though as gay and undepressed<br />
          In mind, as when I thence had taken flight<br /> A few short months
          before. I turned my face<br /> Without repining from the coves and
          heights<br /> Clothed in the sunshine of the withering fern;<br />
          Quitted, not both, the mild magnificence<br /> Of calmer lakes and
          louder streams; and you,<br /> Frank-hearted maids of rocky Cumberland,<br />
          You and your not unwelcome days of mirth,<br /> Relinquished, and your
          nights of revelry,<br /> And in my own unlovely cell sate down<br /> In
          lightsome mood&mdash;such privilege has youth<br /> That cannot take
          long leave of pleasant thoughts.<br /> The bonds of indolent society<br />
          Relaxing in their hold, henceforth I lived<br /> More to myself. Two
          winters may be passed<br /> Without a separate notice: many books<br />
          Were skimmed, devoured, or studiously perused,<br /> But with no
          settled plan. I was detached<br /> Internally from academic cares;<br />
          Yet independent study seemed a course<br /> Of hardy disobedience
          toward friends<br /> And kindred, proud rebellion and unkind.<br /> This
          spurious virtue, rather let it bear<br /> A name it now deserves, this
          cowardice,<br /> Gave treacherous sanction to that over-love<br /> Of
          freedom which encouraged me to turn<br /> From regulations even of my
          own<br /> As from restraints and bonds. Yet who can tell&mdash;<br />
          Who knows what thus may have been gained, both then<br /> And at a
          later season, or preserved;<br /> What love of nature, what original
          strength<br /> Of contemplation, what intuitive truths,<br /> The
          deepest and the best, what keen research,<br /> Unbiassed,
          unbewildered, and unawed?<br /> <br /> The Poet's soul was with me at
          that time;<br /> Sweet meditations, the still overflow<br /> Of present
          happiness, while future years<br /> Lacked not anticipations, tender
          dreams,<br /> No few of which have since been realised;<br /> And some
          remain, hopes for my future life.<br /> Four years and thirty, told
          this very week,<br /> Have I been now a sojourner on earth,<br /> By
          sorrow not unsmitten; yet for me<br /> Life's morning radiance hath not
          left the hills,<br /> Her dew is on the flowers. Those were the days<br />
          Which also first emboldened me to trust<br /> With firmness, hitherto
          but lightly touched<br /> By such a daring thought, that I might leave<br />
          Some monument behind me which pure hearts<br /> Should reverence. The
          instinctive humbleness,<br /> Maintained even by the very name and
          thought<br /> Of printed books and authorship, began<br /> To melt away;
          and further, the dread awe<br /> Of mighty names was softened down and
          seemed<br /> Approachable, admitting fellowship<br /> Of modest
          sympathy. Such aspect now,<br /> Though not familiarly, my mind put on,<br />
          Content to observe, to achieve, and to enjoy.<br /> <br /> All winter
          long, whenever free to choose,<br /> Did I by night frequent the
          College groves<br /> And tributary walks; the last, and oft<br /> The
          only one, who had been lingering there<br /> Through hours of silence,
          till the porter's bell,<br /> A punctual follower on the stroke of
          nine,<br /> Rang with its blunt unceremonious voice,<br /> Inexorable
          summons! Lofty elms,<br /> Inviting shades of opportune recess,<br />
          Bestowed composure on a neighbourhood<br /> Unpeaceful in itself. A
          single tree<br /> With sinuous trunk, boughs exquisitely wreathed,<br />
          Grew there; an ash which Winter for himself<br /> Decked out with
          pride, and with outlandish grace:<br /> Up from the ground, and almost
          to the top,<br /> The trunk and every master branch were green<br />
          With clustering ivy, and the lightsome twigs<br /> And outer spray
          profusely tipped with seeds<br /> That hung in yellow tassels, while
          the air<br /> Stirred them, not voiceless. Often have I stood<br />
          Foot-bound uplooking at this lovely tree<br /> Beneath a frosty moon.
          The hemisphere<br /> Of magic fiction, verse of mine perchance<br /> May
          never tread; but scarcely Spenser's self<br /> Could have more tranquil
          visions in his youth,<br /> Or could more bright appearances create<br />
          Of human forms with superhuman powers,<br /> Than I beheld loitering on
          calm clear nights<br /> Alone, beneath this fairy work of earth.<br />
          <br /> On the vague reading of a truant youth<br /> 'Twere idle to
          descant. My inner judgment<br /> Not seldom differed from my taste in
          books.<br /> As if it appertained to another mind,<br /> And yet the
          books which then I valued most<br /> Are dearest to me <i>now</i>; for,
          having scanned,<br /> Not heedlessly, the laws, and watched the forms<br />
          Of Nature, in that knowledge I possessed<br /> A standard, often
          usefully applied,<br /> Even when unconsciously, to things removed<br />
          From a familiar sympathy.&mdash;In fine,<br /> I was a better judge of
          thoughts than words,<br /> Misled in estimating words, not only<br /> By
          common inexperience of youth,<br /> But by the trade in classic
          niceties,<br /> The dangerous craft of culling term and phrase<br />
          From languages that want the living voice<br /> To carry meaning to the
          natural heart;<br /> To tell us what is passion, what is truth,<br />
          What reason, what simplicity and sense.<br /> <br /> Yet may we not
          entirely overlook<br /> The pleasure gathered from the rudiments<br />
          Of geometric science. Though advanced<br /> In these inquiries, with
          regret I speak,<br /> No farther than the threshold, there I found<br />
          Both elevation and composed delight:<br /> With Indian awe and wonder,
          ignorance pleased<br /> With its own struggles, did I meditate<br /> On
          the relation those abstractions bear<br /> To Nature's laws, and by
          what process led,<br /> Those immaterial agents bowed their heads<br />
          Duly to serve the mind of earth-born man;<br /> From star to star, from
          kindred sphere to sphere,<br /> From system on to system without end.<br />
          <br /> More frequently from the same source I drew<br /> A pleasure
          quiet and profound, a sense<br /> Of permanent and universal sway,<br />
          And paramount belief; there, recognised<br /> A type, for finite
          natures, of the one<br /> Supreme Existence, the surpassing life<br />
          Which&mdash;to the boundaries of space and time,<br /> Of melancholy
          space and doleful time,<br /> Superior, and incapable of change,<br />
          Nor touched by welterings of passion&mdash;is,<br /> And hath the name
          of, God. Transcendent peace<br /> And silence did await upon these
          thoughts<br /> That were a frequent comfort to my youth.<br /> <br />
          'Tis told by one whom stormy waters threw,<br /> With fellow-sufferers
          by the shipwreck spared,<br /> Upon a desert coast, that having brought<br />
          To land a single volume, saved by chance,<br /> A treatise of Geometry,
          he wont,<br /> Although of food and clothing destitute,<br /> And beyond
          common wretchedness depressed,<br /> To part from company and take this
          book<br /> (Then first a self-taught pupil in its truths)<br /> To spots
          remote, and draw his diagrams<br /> With a long staff upon the sand,
          and thus<br /> Did oft beguile his sorrow, and almost<br /> Forget his
          feeling: so (if like effect<br /> From the same cause produced, 'mid
          outward things<br /> So different, may rightly be compared),<br /> So
          was it then with me, and so will be<br /> With Poets ever. Mighty is
          the charm<br /> Of those abstractions to a mind beset<br /> With images,
          and haunted by herself,<br /> And specially delightful unto me<br /> Was
          that clear synthesis built up aloft<br /> So gracefully; even then when
          it appeared<br /> Not more than a mere plaything, or a toy<br /> To
          sense embodied: not the thing it is<br /> In verity, an independent
          world,<br /> Created out of pure intelligence.<br /> <br /> Such
          dispositions then were mine unearned<br /> By aught, I fear, of genuine
          desert&mdash;<br /> Mine, through heaven's grace and inborn aptitudes.<br />
          And not to leave the story of that time<br /> Imperfect, with these
          habits must be joined,<br /> Moods melancholy, fits of spleen, that
          loved<br /> A pensive sky, sad days, and piping winds,<br /> The
          twilight more than dawn, autumn than spring;<br /> A treasured and
          luxurious gloom of choice<br /> And inclination mainly, and the mere<br />
          Redundancy of youth's contentedness.<br /> &mdash;To time thus spent,
          add multitudes of hours<br /> Pilfered away, by what the Bard who sang<br />
          Of the Enchanter Indolence hath called<br /> "Good-natured lounging,"
          and behold a map<br /> Of my collegiate life&mdash;far less intense<br />
          Than duty called for, or, without regard<br /> To duty, <i>might</i>
          have sprung up of itself<br /> By change of accidents, or even, to
          speak<br /> Without unkindness, in another place.<br /> Yet why take
          refuge in that plea?&mdash;the fault,<br /> This I repeat, was mine;
          mine be the blame.<br /> <br /> In summer, making quest for works of
          art,<br /> Or scenes renowned for beauty, I explored<br /> That
          streamlet whose blue current works its way<br /> Between romantic
          Dovedale's spiry rocks;<br /> Pried into Yorkshire dales, or hidden
          tracts<br /> Of my own native region, and was blest<br /> Between these
          sundry wanderings with a joy<br /> Above all joys, that seemed another
          morn<br /> Risen on mid noon; blest with the presence, Friend!<br /> Of

          fractured wall,<br /> Not without trembling, we in safety looked<br />
          Forth, through some Gothic window's open space,<br /> And gathered with
          one mind a rich reward<br /> From the far-stretching landscape, by the
          light<br /> Of morning beautified, or purple eve;<br /> Or, not less
          pleased, lay on some turret's head,<br /> Catching from tufts of grass
          and hare-bell flowers<br /> Their faintest whisper to the passing
          breeze,<br /> Given out while mid-day heat oppressed the plains.<br />
          <br /> Another maid there was, who also shed<br /> A gladness o'er that
          season, then to me,<br /> By her exulting outside look of youth<br />
          And placid under-countenance, first endeared;<br /> That other spirit,
          Coleridge! who is now<br /> So near to us, that meek confiding heart,<br />
          So reverenced by us both. O'er paths and fields<br /> In all that
          neighbourhood, through narrow lanes<br /> Of eglantine, and through the
          shady woods,<br /> And o'er the Border Beacon, and the waste<br /> Of
          naked pools, and common crags that lay<br /> Exposed on the bare felt,
          were scattered love,<br /> The spirit of pleasure, and youth's golden
          gleam.<br /> O Friend! we had not seen thee at that time,<br /> And yet
          a power is on me, and a strong<br /> Confusion, and I seem to plant
          thee there.<br /> Far art thou wandered now in search of health<br />
          And milder breezes,&mdash;melancholy lot!<br /> But thou art with us,
          with us in the past,<br /> The present, with us in the times to come.<br />
          There is no grief, no sorrow, no despair,<br /> No languor, no
          dejection, no dismay,<br /> No absence scarcely can there be, for those<br />
          Who love as we do. Speed thee well! divide<br /> With us thy pleasure;
          thy returning strength,<br /> Receive it daily as a joy of ours;<br />
          Share with us thy fresh spirits, whether gift<br /> Of gales Etesian or
          of tender thoughts.<br /> <br /> I, too, have been a wanderer; but,
          alas!<br /> How different the fate of different men.<br /> Though
          mutually unknown, yea nursed and reared<br /> As if in several
          elements, we were framed<br /> To bend at last to the same discipline,<br />
          Predestined, if two beings ever were,<br /> To seek the same delights,
          and have one health,<br /> One happiness. Throughout this narrative,<br />
          Else sooner ended, I have borne in mind<br /> For whom it registers the
          birth, and marks the growth,<br /> Of gentleness, simplicity, and
          truth,<br /> And joyous loves, that hallow innocent days<br /> Of peace
          and self-command. Of rivers, fields,<br /> And groves I speak to thee,
          my Friend! to thee,<br /> Who, yet a liveried schoolboy, in the depths<br />
          Of the huge city, on the leaded roof<br /> Of that wide edifice, thy
          school and home,<br /> Wert used to lie and gaze upon the clouds<br />
          Moving in heaven; or, of that pleasure tired,<br /> To shut thine eyes,
          and by internal light<br /> See trees, and meadows, and thy native
          stream,<br /> Far distant, thus beheld from year to year<br /> Of a long
          exile. Nor could I forget,<br /> In this late portion of my argument,<br />
          That scarcely, as my term of pupilage<br /> Ceased, had I left those
          academic bowers<br /> When thou wert thither guided. From the heart<br />
          Of London, and from cloisters there, thou camest,<br /> And didst sit
          down in temperance and peace,<br /> A rigorous student. What a stormy
          course<br /> Then followed. Oh! it is a pang that calls<br /> For
          utterance, to think what easy change<br /> Of circumstances might to
          thee have spared<br /> A world of pain, ripened a thousand hopes,<br />
          For ever withered. Through this retrospect<br /> Of my collegiate life
          I still have had<br /> Thy after-sojourn in the self-same place<br />
          Present before my eyes, have played with times<br /> And accidents as
          children do with cards,<br /> Or as a man, who, when his house is
          built,<br /> A frame locked up in wood and stone, doth still,<br /> As
          impotent fancy prompts, by his fireside,<br /> Rebuild it to his
          liking. I have thought<br /> Of thee, thy learning, gorgeous eloquence,<br />
          And all the strength and plumage of thy youth,<br /> Thy subtle
          speculations, toils abstruse<br /> Among the schoolmen, and Platonic
          forms<br /> Of wild ideal pageantry, shaped out<br /> From things
          well-matched or ill, and words for things,<br /> The self-created
          sustenance of a mind<br /> Debarred from Nature's living images,<br />
          Compelled to be a life unto herself,<br /> And unrelentingly possessed
          by thirst<br /> Of greatness, love, and beauty. Not alone,<br /> Ah!
          surely not in singleness of heart<br /> Should I have seen the light of
          evening fade<br /> From smooth Cam's silent waters: had we met,<br />
          Even at that early time, needs must I trust<br /> In the belief, that
          my maturer age,<br /> My calmer habits, and more steady voice,<br />
          Would with an influence benign have soothed,<br /> Or chased away, the
          airy wretchedness<br /> That battened on thy youth. But thou hast trod<br />
          A march of glory, which doth put to shame<br /> These vain regrets;
          health suffers in thee, else<br /> Such grief for thee would be the
          weakest thought<br /> That ever harboured in the breast of man.<br />
          <br /> A passing word erewhile did lightly touch<br /> On wanderings of
          my own, that now embraced<br /> With livelier hope a region wider far.<br />
          <br /> When the third summer freed us from restraint,<br /> A youthful
          friend, he too a mountaineer,<br /> Not slow to share my wishes, took
          his staff,<br /> And sallying forth, we journeyed side by side,<br />
          Bound to the distant Alps. A hardy slight<br /> Did this unprecedented
          course imply<br /> Of college studies and their set rewards;<br /> Nor
          had, in truth, the scheme been formed by me<br /> Without uneasy
          forethought of the pain,<br /> The censures, and ill-omening of those<br />
          To whom my worldly interests were dear.<br /> But Nature then was
          sovereign in my mind,<br /> And mighty forms, seizing a youthful fancy,<br />
          Had given a charter to irregular hopes.<br /> In any age of uneventful
          calm<br /> Among the nations, surely would my heart<br /> Have been
          possessed by similar desire;<br /> But Europe at that time was thrilled
          with joy,<br /> France standing on the top of golden hours,<br /> And
          human nature seeming born again.<br /> <br /> Lightly equipped, and but
          a few brief looks<br /> Cast on the white cliffs of our native shore<br />
          From the receding vessel's deck, we chanced<br /> To land at Calais on
          the very eve<br /> Of that great federal day; and there we saw,<br /> In
          a mean city, and among a few,<br /> How bright a face is worn when joy
          of one<br /> Is joy for tens of millions. Southward thence<br /> We held
          our way, direct through hamlets, towns,<br /> Gaudy with reliques of
          that festival,<br /> Flowers left to wither on triumphal arcs,<br /> And
          window-garlands. On the public roads,<br /> And, once, three days
          successively, through paths<br /> By which our toilsome journey was
          abridged,<br /> Among sequestered villages we walked<br /> And found
          benevolence and blessedness<br /> Spread like a fragrance everywhere,
          when spring<br /> Hath left no corner of the land untouched:<br /> Where
          elms for many and many a league in files<br /> With their thin umbrage,
          on the stately roads<br /> Of that great kingdom, rustled o'er our
          heads,<br /> For ever near us as we paced along:<br /> How sweet at such
          a time, with such delight<br /> On every side, in prime of youthful
          strength,<br /> To feed a Poet's tender melancholy<br /> And fond
          conceit of sadness, with the sound<br /> Of undulations varying as
          might please<br /> The wind that swayed them; once, and more than once,<br />
          Unhoused beneath the evening star we saw<br /> Dances of liberty, and,
          in late hours<br /> Of darkness, dances in the open air<br /> Deftly
          prolonged, though grey-haired lookers on<br /> Might waste their breath
          in chiding.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under hills&mdash;<br /> The vine-clad hills and
          slopes of Burgundy,<br /> Upon the bosom of the gentle Sa&ocirc;ne<br />
          We glided forward with the flowing stream,<br /> Swift Rhone! thou wert
          the <i>wings</i> on which we cut<br /> A winding passage with majestic
          ease<br /> Between thy lofty rocks. Enchanting show<br /> Those woods
          and farms and orchards did present<br /> And single cottages and
          lurking towns,<br /> Reach after reach, succession without end<br /> Of
          deep and stately vales! A lonely pair<br /> Of strangers, till day
          closed, we sailed along,<br /> Clustered together with a merry crowd<br />
          Of those emancipated, a blithe host<br /> Of travellers, chiefly
          delegates returning<br /> From the great spousals newly solemnised<br />
          At their chief city, in the sight of Heaven.<br /> Like bees they
          swarmed, gaudy and gay as bees;<br /> Some vapoured in the unruliness
          of joy,<br /> And with their swords flourished as if to fight<br /> The
          saucy air. In this proud company<br /> We landed&mdash;took with them
          our evening meal,<br /> Guests welcome almost as the angels were<br />
          To Abraham of old. The supper done,<br /> With flowing cups elate and
          happy thoughts<br /> We rose at signal given, and formed a ring<br />
          And, hand in hand, danced round and round the board;<br /> All hearts
          were open, every tongue was loud<br /> With amity and glee; we bore a
          name<br /> Honoured in France, the name of Englishmen,<br /> And
          hospitably did they give us hail,<br /> As their forerunners in a
          glorious course;<br /> And round and round the board we danced again.<br />
          With these blithe friends our voyage we renewed<br /> At early dawn.
          The monastery bells<br /> Made a sweet jingling in our youthful ears;<br />
          The rapid river flowing without noise,<br /> And each uprising or
          receding spire<br /> Spake with a sense of peace, at intervals<br />
          Touching the heart amid the boisterous crew<br /> By whom we were
          encompassed. Taking leave<br /> Of this glad throng, foot-travellers
          side by side,<br /> Measuring our steps in quiet, we pursued<br /> Our
          journey, and ere twice the sun had set<br /> Beheld the Convent of
          Chartreuse, and there<br /> Rested within an awful <i>solitude:</i><br />
          Yes, for even then no other than a place<br /> Of soul-affecting <i>solitude</i>
          appeared<br /> That far-famed region, though our eyes had seen,<br /> As
          toward the sacred mansion we advanced,<br /> Arms flashing, and a
          military glare<br /> Of riotous men commissioned to expel<br /> The
          blameless inmates, and belike subvert<br /> That frame of social being,
          which so long<br /> Had bodied forth the ghostliness of things<br /> In
          silence visible and perpetual calm.<br /> <br /> &mdash;"Stay, stay your
          sacrilegious hands!"&mdash;The voice<br /> Was Nature's, uttered from
          her Alpine throne;<br /> I heard it then and seem to hear it now&mdash;<br />
          "Your impious work forbear, perish what may,<br /> Let this one temple
          last, be this one spot<br /> Of earth devoted to eternity!"<br /> She
          ceased to speak, but while St. Bruno's pines<br /> Waved their dark
          tops, not silent as they waved,<br /> And while below, along their
          several beds,<br /> Murmured the sister streams of Life and Death,<br />
          Thus by conflicting passions pressed, my heart<br /> Responded; "Honour
          to the patriot's zeal!<br /> Glory and hope to new-born Liberty!<br />
          Hail to the mighty projects of the time!<br /> Discerning sword that
          Justice wields, do thou<br /> Go forth and prosper; and, ye purging
          fires,<br /> Up to the loftiest towers of Pride ascend,<br /> Fanned by
          the breath of angry Providence.<br /> But oh! if Past and Future be the
          wings,<br /> On whose support harmoniously conjoined<br /> Moves the
          great spirit of human knowledge, spare<br /> These courts of mystery,
          where a step advanced<br /> Between the portals of the shadowy rocks<br />
          Leaves far behind life's treacherous vanities,<br /> For penitential
          tears and trembling hopes<br /> Exchanged&mdash;to equalise in God's
          pure sight<br /> Monarch and peasant: be the house redeemed<br /> With
          its unworldly votaries, for the sake<br /> Of conquest over sense,
          hourly achieved<br /> Through faith and meditative reason, resting<br />
          Upon the word of heaven-imparted truth,<br /> Calmly triumphant; and
          for humbler claim<br /> Of that imaginative impulse sent<br /> From
          these majestic floods, yon shining cliffs,<br /> The untransmuted
          shapes of many worlds,<br /> Cerulean ether's pure inhabitants,<br />
          These forests unapproachable by death,<br /> That shall endure as long
          as man endures,<br /> To think, to hope, to worship, and to feel,<br />
          To struggle, to be lost within himself<br /> In trepidation, from the
          blank abyss<br /> To look with bodily eyes, and be consoled."<br /> Not
          seldom since that moment have I wished<br /> That thou, O Friend! the
          trouble or the calm<br /> Hadst shared, when, from profane regards
          apart,<br /> In sympathetic reverence we trod<br /> The floors of those
          dim cloisters, till that hour,<br /> From their foundation, strangers
          to the presence<br /> Of unrestricted and unthinking man.<br /> Abroad,
          how cheeringly the sunshine lay<br /> Upon the open lawns! Vallombre's
          groves<br /> Entering, we fed the soul with darkness; thence<br />
          Issued, and with uplifted eyes beheld,<br /> In different quarters of
          the bending sky,<br /> The cross of Jesus stand erect, as if<br /> Hands
          of angelic powers had fixed it there,<br /> Memorial reverenced by a
          thousand storms;<br /> Yet then, from the undiscriminating sweep<br />
          And rage of one State-whirlwind, insecure.<br /> <br /> 'Tis not my
          present purpose to retrace<br /> That variegated journey step by step.<br />
          A march it was of military speed,<br /> And Earth did change her images
          and forms<br /> Before us, fast as clouds are changed in heaven.<br />
          Day after day, up early and down late,<br /> From hill to vale we
          dropped, from vale to hill<br /> Mounted&mdash;from province on to
          province swept,<br /> Keen hunters in a chase of fourteen weeks,<br />
          Eager as birds of prey, or as a ship<br /> Upon the stretch, when winds
          are blowing fair:<br /> Sweet coverts did we cross of pastoral life,<br />
          Enticing valleys, greeted them and left<br /> Too soon, while yet the
          very flash and gleam<br /> Of salutation were not passed away.<br /> Oh!
          sorrow for the youth who could have seen<br /> Unchastened, unsubdued,
          unawed, unraised<br /> To patriarchal dignity of mind,<br /> And pure
          simplicity of wish and will,<br /> Those sanctified abodes of peaceful
          man,<br /> Pleased (though to hardship born, and compassed round<br />
          With danger, varying as the seasons change),<br /> Pleased with his
          daily task, or, if not pleased,<br /> Contented, from the moment that
          the dawn<br /> (Ah! surely not without attendant gleams<br /> Of
          soul-illumination) calls him forth<br /> To industry, by glistenings
          flung on rocks,<br /> Whose evening shadows lead him to repose,<br />
          Well might a stranger look with bounding heart<br /> Down on a green
          recess, the first I saw<br /> Of those deep haunts, an aboriginal vale,<br />
          Quiet and lorded over and possessed<br /> By naked huts, wood-built,
          and sown like tents<br /> Or Indian cabins over the fresh lawns<br />
          And by the river side.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That very day,<br /> From a bare
          ridge we also first beheld<br /> Unveiled the summit of Mont Blanc, and
          grieved<br /> To have a soulless image on the eye<br /> That had usurped
          upon a living thought<br /> That never more could be. The wondrous Vale<br />
          Of Chamouny stretched far below, and soon<br /> With its dumb cataracts
          and streams of ice,<br /> A motionless array of mighty waves,<br /> Five
          rivers broad and vast, made rich amends,<br /> And reconciled us to
          realities;<br /> There small birds warble from the leafy trees,<br />
          The eagle soars high in the element,<br /> There doth the reaper bind
          the yellow sheaf,<br /> The maiden spread the haycock in the sun,<br />
          While Winter like a well-tamed lion walks,<br /> Descending from the
          mountain to make sport<br /> Among the cottages by beds of flowers.<br />
          <br /> Whate'er in this wide circuit we beheld,<br /> Or heard, was
          fitted to our unripe state<br /> Of intellect and heart. With such a
          book<br /> Before our eyes, we could not choose but read<br /> Lessons
          of genuine brotherhood, the plain<br /> And universal reason of
          mankind,<br /> The truths of young and old. Nor, side by side<br />
          Pacing, two social pilgrims, or alone<br /> Each with his humour, could
          we fail to abound<br /> In dreams and fictions, pensively composed:<br />
          Dejection taken up for pleasure's sake,<br /> And gilded sympathies,
          the willow wreath,<br /> And sober posies of funereal flowers,<br />
          Gathered among those solitudes sublime<br /> From formal gardens of the
          lady Sorrow,<br /> Did sweeten many a meditative hour.<br /> <br /> Yet
          still in me with those soft luxuries<br /> Mixed something of stem
          mood, an under-thirst<br /> Of vigour seldom utterly allayed.<br /> And
          from that source how different a sadness<br /> Would issue, let one
          incident make known.<br /> When from the Vallais we had turned, and
          clomb<br /> Along the Simplon's steep and rugged road, <br /> Following
          a band of muleteers, we reached<br /> A halting-place, where all
          together took<br /> Their noon-tide meal. Hastily rose our guide,<br />
          Leaving us at the board; awhile we lingered,<br /> Then paced the
          beaten downward way that led<br /> Right to a rough stream's edge, and
          there broke off;<br /> The only track now visible was one<br /> That
          from the torrent's further brink held forth<br /> Conspicuous
          invitation to ascend<br /> A lofty mountain. After brief delay<br />
          Crossing the unbridged stream, that road we took,<br /> And clomb with
          eagerness, till anxious fears<br /> Intruded, for we failed to overtake<br />
          Our comrades gone before. By fortunate chance,<br /> While every moment
          added doubt to doubt,<br /> A peasant met us, from whose mouth we
          learned<br /> That to the spot which had perplexed us first<br /> We
          must descend, and there should find the road,<br /> Which in the stony
          channel of the stream<br /> Lay a few steps, and then along its banks;<br />
          And, that our future course, all plain to sight,<br /> Was downwards,
          with the current of that stream.<br /> Loth to believe what we so
          grieved to hear,<br /> For still we had hopes that pointed to the
          clouds,<br /> We questioned him again, and yet again;<br /> But every
          word that from the peasant's lips<br /> Came in reply, translated by
          our feelings,<br /> Ended in this,&mdash;'that we had crossed the
          Alps'.<br /> <br /> Imagination&mdash;here the Power so called<br />
          Through sad incompetence of human speech,<br /> That awful Power rose
          from the mind's abyss<br /> Like an unfathered vapour that enwraps,<br />
          At once, some lonely traveller. I was lost;<br /> Halted without an
          effort to break through;<br /> But to my conscious soul I now can say&mdash;<br />
          "I recognise thy glory:" in such strength<br /> Of usurpation, when the
          light of sense<br /> Goes out, but with a flash that has revealed<br />
          The invisible world, doth greatness make abode,<br /> There harbours;
          whether we be young or old,<br /> Our destiny, our being's heart and
          home,<br /> Is with infinitude, and only there;<br /> With hope it is,
          hope that can never die,<br /> Effort, and expectation, and desire,<br />
          And something evermore about to be.<br /> Under such banners militant,
          the soul<br /> Seeks for no trophies, struggles for no spoils<br /> That
          may attest her prowess, blest in thoughts<br /> That are their own
          perfection and reward,<br /> Strong in herself and in beatitude<br />
          That hides her, like the mighty flood of Nile<br /> Poured from his
          fount of Abyssinian clouds<br /> To fertilise the whole Egyptian plain.<br />
          <br /> The melancholy slackening that ensued<br /> Upon those tidings by
          the peasant given<br /> Was soon dislodged. Downwards we hurried fast,<br />
          And, with the half-shaped road which we had missed,<br /> Entered a
          narrow chasm. The brook and road<br /> Were fellow-travellers in this
          gloomy strait, <br /> And with them did we journey several hours<br />
          At a slow pace. The immeasurable height<br /> Of woods decaying, never
          to be decayed,<br /> The stationary blasts of waterfalls,<br /> And in
          the narrow rent at every turn<br /> Winds thwarting winds, bewildered
          and forlorn,<br /> The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,<br />
          The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,<br /> Black drizzling
          crags that spake by the way-side<br /> As if a voice were in them, the
          sick sight<br /> And giddy prospect of the raving stream,<br /> The
          unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens,<br /> Tumult and peace,
          the darkness and the light&mdash;<br /> Were all like workings of one
          mind, the features<br /> Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree;<br />
          Characters of the great Apocalypse,<br /> The types and symbols of
          Eternity,<br /> Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.<br />
          <br /> That night our lodging was a house that stood<br /> Alone within
          the valley, at a point<br /> Where, tumbling from aloft, a torrent
          swelled<br /> The rapid stream whose margin we had trod;<br /> A dreary
          mansion, large beyond all need, <br /> With high and spacious rooms,
          deafened and stunned<br /> By noise of waters, making innocent sleep<br />
          Lie melancholy among weary bones.<br /> <br /> Uprisen betimes, our
          journey we renewed,<br /> Led by the stream, ere noon-day magnified<br />
          Into a lordly river, broad and deep,<br /> Dimpling along in silent
          majesty,<br /> With mountains for its neighbours, and in view<br /> Of
          distant mountains and their snowy tops,<br /> And thus proceeding to
          Locarno's Lake, <br /> Fit resting-place for such a visitant.<br />
          Locarno! spreading out in width like Heaven,<br /> How dost thou cleave
          to the poetic heart,<br /> Bask in the sunshine of the memory;<br /> And
          Como! thou, a treasure whom the earth<br /> Keeps to herself, confined
          as in a depth<br /> Of Abyssinian privacy. I spake<br /> Of thee, thy
          chestnut woods, and garden plots<br /> Of Indian corn tended by
          dark-eyed maids;<br /> Thy lofty steeps, and pathways roofed with
          vines,<br /> Winding from house to house, from town to town,<br /> Sole
          link that binds them to each other; walks,<br /> League after league,
          and cloistral avenues,<br /> Where silence dwells if music be not
          there:<br /> While yet a youth undisciplined in verse,<br /> Through
          fond ambition of that hour I strove<br /> To chant your praise; nor can
          approach you now<br /> Ungreeted by a more melodious Song,<br /> Where
          tones of Nature smoothed by learned Art<br /> May flow in lasting
          current. Like a breeze<br /> Or sunbeam over your domain I passed<br />
          In motion without pause; but ye have left<br /> Your beauty with me, a
          serene accord<br /> Of forms and colours, passive, yet endowed<br /> In
          their submissiveness with power as sweet<br /> And gracious, almost
          might I dare to say,<br /> As virtue is, or goodness; sweet as love,<br />
          Or the remembrance of a generous deed,<br /> Or mildest visitations of
          pure thought,<br /> When God, the giver of all joy, is thanked<br />
          Religiously, in silent blessedness;<br /> Sweet as this last herself,
          for such it is.<br /> <br /> With those delightful pathways we advanced,<br />
          For two days' space, in presence of the Lake,<br /> That, stretching
          far among the Alps, assumed<br /> A character more stern. The second
          night,<br /> From sleep awakened, and misled by sound<br /> Of the
          church clock telling the hours with strokes<br /> Whose import then we
          had not learned, we rose<br /> By moonlight, doubting not that day was
          nigh,<br /> And that meanwhile, by no uncertain path,<br /> Along the
          winding margin of the lake,<br /> Led, as before, we should behold the
          scene<br /> Hushed in profound repose. We left the town<br /> Of
          Gravedona with this hope; but soon<br /> Were lost, bewildered among
          woods immense,<br /> And on a rock sate down, to wait for day.<br /> An
          open place it was, and overlooked,<br /> From high, the sullen water
          far beneath,<br /> On which a dull red image of the moon<br /> Lay
          bedded, changing oftentimes its form<br /> Like an uneasy snake. From
          hour to hour<br /> We sate and sate, wondering, as if the night<br />
          Had been ensnared by witchcraft. On the rock<br /> At last we stretched
          our weary limbs for sleep,<br /> But <i>could not</i> sleep, tormented
          by the stings<br /> Of insects, which, with noise like that of noon,<br />
          Filled all the woods; the cry of unknown birds;<br /> The mountains
          more by blackness visible<br /> And their own size, than any outward
          light;<br /> The breathless wilderness of clouds; the clock<br /> That
          told, with unintelligible voice,<br /> The widely parted hours; the
          noise of streams,<br /> And sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand,<br />
          That did not leave us free from personal fear;<br /> And, lastly, the
          withdrawing moon, that set<br /> Before us, while she still was high in
          heaven;&mdash;<br /> These were our food; and such a summer's night
          <br /> Followed that pair of golden days that shed<br /> On Como's Lake,
          and all that round it lay,<br /> Their fairest, softest, happiest
          influence.<br /> <br /> But here I must break off, and bid farewell<br />
          To days, each offering some new sight, or fraught<br /> With some
          untried adventure, in a course<br /> Prolonged till sprinklings of
          autumnal snow<br /> Checked our unwearied steps. Let this alone<br /> Be
          mentioned as a parting word, that not<br /> In hollow exultation,
          dealing out<br /> Hyperboles of praise comparative;<br /> Not rich one
          moment to be poor for ever;<br /> Not prostrate, overborne, as if the
          mind<br /> Herself were nothing, a mere pensioner<br /> On outward forms&mdash;did
          we in presence stand<br /> Of that magnificent region. On the front<br />
          Of this whole Song is written that my heart<br /> Must, in such Temple,
          needs have offered up<br /> A different worship. Finally, whate'er<br />
          I saw, or heard, or felt, was but a stream<br /> That flowed into a
          kindred stream; a gale,<br /> Confederate with the current of the soul,<br />
          To speed my voyage; every sound or sight,<br /> In its degree of power,
          administered<br /> To grandeur or to tenderness,&mdash;to the one<br />
          Directly, but to tender thoughts by means<br /> Less often
          instantaneous in effect;<br /> Led me to these by paths that, in the
          main,<br /> Were more circuitous, but not less sure<br /> Duly to reach
          the point marked out by Heaven.<br /> <br /> Oh, most belov&egrave;d
          Friend! a glorious time,<br /> A happy time that was; triumphant looks<br />
          Were then the common language of all eyes;<br /> As if awaked from
          sleep, the Nations hailed<br /> Their great expectancy: the fife of war<br />
          Was then a spirit-stirring sound indeed,<br /> A black-bird's whistle
          in a budding grove.<br /> We left the Swiss exulting in the fate<br />
          Of their near neighbours; and, when shortening fast<br /> Our
          pilgrimage, nor distant far from home,<br /> We crossed the Brabant
          armies on the fret <br /> For battle in the cause of Liberty.<br /> A
          stripling, scarcely of the household then<br /> Of social life, I
          looked upon these things<br /> As from a distance; heard, and saw, and
          felt,<br /> Was touched, but with no intimate concern;<br /> I seemed to
          move along them, as a bird<br /> Moves through the air, or as a fish
          pursues<br /> Its sport, or feeds in its proper element;<br /> I wanted
          not that joy, I did not need<br /> Such help; the ever-living universe,<br />
          Turn where I might, was opening out its glories,<br /> And the
          independent spirit of pure youth<br /> Called forth, at every season,
          new delights<br /> Spread round my steps like sunshine o'er green
          fields.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="#Ctoc">Contents&mdash;<i>The

      the Christmas holidays of 1790 at Forncett Rectory in Norfolk, where his

          Six changeful years have vanished since I first<br /> Poured out
          (saluted by that quickening breeze<br /> Which met me issuing from the
          City's walls)<br /> A glad preamble to this Verse: I sang<br /> Aloud,
          with fervour irresistible<br /> Of short-lived transport, like a
          torrent bursting,<br /> From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side<br />
          To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth<br /> (So willed the Muse)
          a less impetuous stream,<br /> That flowed awhile with unabating
          strength,<br /> Then stopped for years; not audible again<br /> Before
          last primrose-time, Beloved Friend!<br /> The assurance which then
          cheered some heavy thoughts<br /> On thy departure to a foreign land<br />
          Has failed; too slowly moves the promised work.<br /> Through the whole
          summer have I been at rest,<br /> Partly from voluntary holiday,<br />
          And part through outward hindrance. But I heard,<br /> After the hour
          of sunset yester-even,<br /> Sitting within doors between light and
          dark,<br /> A choir of redbreasts gathered somewhere near<br /> My
          threshold,&mdash;minstrels from the distant woods<br /> Sent in on
          Winter's service, to announce,<br /> With preparation artful and
          benign,<br /> That the rough lord had left the surly North<br /> On his
          accustomed journey. The delight,<br /> Due to this timely notice,
          unawares<br /> Smote me, and, listening, I in whispers said,<br /> "Ye
          heartsome Choristers, ye and I will be<br /> Associates, and, unscared
          by blustering winds,<br /> Will chant together." Thereafter, as the
          shades<br /> Of twilight deepened, going forth, I spied<br /> A
          glow-worm underneath a dusky plume<br /> Or canopy of yet unwithered
          fern,<br /> Clear-shining, like a hermit's taper seen<br /> Through a
          thick forest. Silence touched me here<br /> No less than sound had done
          before; the child<br /> Of Summer, lingering, shining, by herself,<br />
          The voiceless worm on the unfrequented hills,<br /> Seemed sent on the
          same errand with the choir<br /> Of Winter that had warbled at my door,<br />
          And the whole year breathed tenderness and love.<br /> <br /> The last
          night's genial feeling overflowed<br /> Upon this morning, and my
          favourite grove,<br /> Tossing in sunshine its dark boughs aloft,<br />
          As if to make the strong wind visible,<br /> Wakes in me agitations
          like its own,<br /> A spirit friendly to the Poet's task,<br /> Which we
          will now resume with lively hope,<br /> Nor checked by aught of tamer
          argument<br /> That lies before us, needful to be told.<br /> <br />
          Returned from that excursion, soon I bade<br /> Farewell for ever to
          the sheltered seats<br /> Of gown&egrave;d students, quitted hall and
          bower,<br /> And every comfort of that privileged ground,<br /> Well
          pleased to pitch a vagrant tent among<br /> The unfenced regions of
          society.<br /> <br /> Yet, undetermined to what course of life<br /> I
          should adhere, and seeming to possess<br /> A little space of
          intermediate time<br /> At full command, to London first I turned,<br />
          In no disturbance of excessive hope,<br /> By personal ambition
          unenslaved,<br /> Frugal as there was need, and, though self-willed,<br />
          From dangerous passions free. Three years had flown<br /> Since I had
          felt in heart and soul the shock<br /> Of the huge town's first
          presence, and had paced<br /> Her endless streets, a transient
          visitant:<br /> Now, fixed amid that concourse of mankind<br /> Where
          Pleasure whirls about incessantly,<br /> And life and labour seem but
          one, I filled<br /> An idler's place; an idler well content<br /> To
          have a house (what matter for a home?)<br /> That owned him; living
          cheerfully abroad<br /> With unchecked fancy ever on the stir,<br /> And
          all my young affections out of doors.<br /> <br /> There was a time when
          whatsoe'er is feigned<br /> Of airy palaces, and gardens built<br /> By
          Genii of romance; or hath in grave<br /> Authentic history been set
          forth of Rome,<br /> Alcairo, Babylon, or Persepolis;<br /> Or given
          upon report by pilgrim friars,<br /> Of golden cities ten months'
          journey deep<br /> Among Tartarian wilds&mdash;fell short, far short,<br />
          Of what my fond simplicity believed<br /> And thought of London&mdash;held
          me by a chain<br /> Less strong of wonder and obscure delight.<br />
          Whether the bolt of childhood's Fancy shot<br /> For me beyond its
          ordinary mark,<br /> 'Twere vain to ask; but in our flock of boys<br />
          Was One, a cripple from his birth, whom chance<br /> Summoned from
          school to London; fortunate<br /> And envied traveller! When the Boy
          returned,<br /> After short absence, curiously I scanned<br /> His mien
          and person, nor was free, in sooth,<br /> From disappointment, not to
          find some change<br /> In look and air, from that new region brought,<br />
          As if from Fairy-land. Much I questioned him;<br /> And every word he
          uttered, on my ears<br /> Fell flatter than a cag&egrave;d parrot's
          note,<br /> That answers unexpectedly awry,<br /> And mocks the
          prompter's listening. Marvellous things<br /> Had vanity (quick Spirit
          that appears<br /> Almost as deeply seated and as strong<br /> In a
          Child's heart as fear itself) conceived<br /> For my enjoyment. Would
          that I could now<br /> Recal what then I pictured to myself,<br /> Of
          mitred Prelates, Lords in ermine clad,<br /> The King, and the King's
          Palace, and, not last,<br /> Nor least, Heaven bless him! the renowned
          Lord Mayor:<br /> Dreams not unlike to those which once begat<br /> A
          change of purpose in young Whittington,<br /> When he, a friendless and
          a drooping boy,<br /> Sate on a stone, and heard the bells speak out<br />
          Articulate music. Above all, one thought<br /> Baffled my
          understanding: how men lived<br /> Even next-door neighbours, as we
          say, yet still<br /> Strangers, not knowing each the other's name.<br />
          <br /> O, wond'rous power of words, by simple faith<br /> Licensed to
          take the meaning that we love!<br /> Vauxhall and Ranelagh! I then had
          heard<br /> Of your green groves, and wilderness of lamps<br /> Dimming
          the stars, and fireworks magical,<br /> And gorgeous ladies, under
          splendid domes,<br /> Floating in dance, or warbling high in air<br />
          The songs of spirits! Nor had Fancy fed<br /> With less delight upon
          that other class<br /> Of marvels, broad-day wonders permanent:<br />
          The River proudly bridged; the dizzy top<br /> And Whispering Gallery
          of St. Paul's; the tombs<br /> Of Westminster; the Giants of Guildhall;<br />
          Bedlam, and those carved maniacs at the gates,<br /> Perpetually
          recumbent; Statues&mdash;man,<br /> And the horse under him&mdash;in
          gilded pomp<br /> Adorning flowery gardens, 'mid vast squares;<br /> The
          Monument, and that Chamber of the Tower<br /> Where England's
          sovereigns sit in long array,<br /> Their steeds bestriding,&mdash;every
          mimic shape<br /> Cased in the gleaming mail the monarch wore,<br />
          Whether for gorgeous tournament addressed,<br /> Or life or death upon
          the battle-field.<br /> Those bold imaginations in due time<br /> Had
          vanished, leaving others in their stead:<br /> And now I looked upon
          the living scene;<br /> Familiarly perused it; oftentimes,<br /> In
          spite of strongest disappointment, pleased<br /> Through courteous
          self-submission, as a tax<br /> Paid to the object by prescriptive
          right.<br /> <br /> Rise up, thou monstrous ant-hill on the plain<br />
          Of a too busy world! Before me flow,<br /> Thou endless stream of men
          and moving things!<br /> Thy every-day appearance, as it strikes&mdash;<br />
          With wonder heightened, or sublimed by awe&mdash;<br /> On strangers,
          of all ages; the quick dance<br /> Of colours, lights, and forms; the
          deafening din;<br /> The comers and the goers face to face,<br /> Face
          after face; the string of dazzling wares,<br /> Shop after shop, with
          symbols, blazoned names,<br /> And all the tradesman's honours
          overhead:<br /> Here, fronts of houses, like a title-page,<br /> With
          letters huge inscribed from top to toe,<br /> Stationed above the door,
          like guardian saints;<br /> There, allegoric shapes, female or male,<br />
          Or physiognomies of real men,<br /> Land-warriors, kings, or admirals
          of the sea,<br /> Boyle, Shakespeare, Newton, or the attractive head<br />
          Of some quack-doctor, famous in his day.<br /> <br /> Meanwhile the roar
          continues, till at length,<br /> Escaped as from an enemy, we turn<br />
          Abruptly into some sequestered nook,<br /> Still as a sheltered place
          when winds blow loud!<br /> At leisure, thence, through tracts of thin
          resort,<br /> And sights and sounds that come at intervals,<br /> We
          take our way. A raree-show is here,<br /> With children gathered round;
          another street<br /> Presents a company of dancing dogs,<br /> Or
          dromedary, with an antic pair<br /> Of monkeys on his back; a minstrel
          band<br /> Of Savoyards; or, single and alone,<br /> An English
          ballad-singer. Private courts,<br /> Gloomy as coffins, and unsightly
          lanes<br /> Thrilled by some female vendor's scream, belike<br /> The
          very shrillest of all London cries,<br /> May then entangle our
          impatient steps;<br /> Conducted through those labyrinths, unawares,<br />
          To privileged regions and inviolate,<br /> Where from their airy lodges
          studious lawyers<br /> Look out on waters, walks, and gardens green.<br />
          <br /> Thence back into the throng, until we reach,<br /> Following the
          tide that slackens by degrees,<br /> Some half-frequented scene, where
          wider streets<br /> Bring straggling breezes of suburban air.<br /> Here
          files of ballads dangle from dead walls;<br /> Advertisements, of
          giant-size, from high<br /> Press forward, in all colours, on the
          sight;<br /> These, bold in conscious merit, lower down;<br /> <i>That</i>,
          fronted with a most imposing word,<br /> Is, peradventure, one in
          masquerade.<br /> As on the broadening causeway we advance,<br />
          Behold, turned upwards, a face hard and strong<br /> In lineaments, and
          red with over-toil.<br /> 'Tis one encountered here and everywhere;<br />
          A travelling cripple, by the trunk cut short,<br /> And stumping on his
          arms. In sailor's garb<br /> Another lies at length, beside a range<br />
          Of well-formed characters, with chalk inscribed<br /> Upon the smooth
          flat stones: the Nurse is here,<br /> The Bachelor, that loves to sun
          himself,<br /> The military Idler, and the Dame,<br /> That field-ward
          takes her walk with decent steps.<br /> <br /> Now homeward through the
          thickening hubbub, where<br /> See, among less distinguishable shapes,<br />
          The begging scavenger, with hat in hand;<br /> The Italian, as he
          thrids his way with care,<br /> Steadying, far-seen, a frame of images<br />
          Upon his head; with basket at his breast<br /> The Jew; the stately and
          slow-moving Turk,<br /> With freight of slippers piled beneath his arm!<br />
          <br /> Enough;&mdash;the mighty concourse I surveyed<br /> With no
          unthinking mind, well pleased to note<br /> Among the crowd all
          specimens of man,<br /> Through all the colours which the sun bestows,<br />
          And every character of form and face:<br /> The Swede, the Russian;
          from the genial south,<br /> The Frenchman and the Spaniard; from
          remote<br /> America, the Hunter-Indian; Moors,<br /> Malays, Lascars,
          the Tartar, the Chinese,<br /> And Negro Ladies in white muslin gowns.<br />
          <br /> At leisure, then, I viewed, from day to day,<br /> The spectacles
          within doors,&mdash;birds and beasts<br /> Of every nature, and strange
          plants convened<br /> From every clime; and, next, those sights that
          ape<br /> The absolute presence of reality,<br /> Expressing, as in
          mirror, sea and land,<br /> And what earth is, and what she has to
          shew.<br /> I do not here allude to subtlest craft,<br /> By means
          refined attaining purest ends,<br /> But imitations, fondly made in
          plain<br /> Confession of man's weakness and his loves.<br /> Whether
          the Painter, whose ambitious skill<br /> Submits to nothing less than
          taking in<br /> A whole horizon's circuit, do with power,<br /> Like
          that of angels or commissioned spirits,<br /> Fix us upon some lofty
          pinnacle,<br /> Or in a ship on waters, with a world<br /> Of life, and
          life-like mockery beneath,<br /> Above, behind, far stretching and
          before;<br /> Or more mechanic artist represent<br /> By scale exact, in
          model, wood or clay,<br /> From blended colours also borrowing help,<br />
          Some miniature of famous spots or things,&mdash;<br /> St. Peter's
          Church; or, more aspiring aim,<br /> In microscopic vision, Rome
          herself;<br /> Or, haply, some choice rural haunt,&mdash;the Falls<br />
          Of Tivoli; and, high upon that steep,<br /> The Sibyl's mouldering
          Temple! every tree,<br /> Villa, or cottage, lurking among rocks<br />
          Throughout the landscape; tuft, stone scratch minute&mdash;<br /> All
          that the traveller sees when he is there.<br /> <br /> Add to these
          exhibitions, mute and still,<br /> Others of wider scope, where living
          men,<br /> Music, and shifting pantomimic scenes,<br /> Diversified the
          allurement. Need I fear<br /> To mention by its name, as in degree,<br />
          Lowest of these and humblest in attempt,<br /> Yet richly graced with
          honours of her own,<br /> Half-rural Sadler's Wells? Though at that
          time<br /> Intolerant, as is the way of youth<br /> Unless itself be
          pleased, here more than once<br /> Taking my seat, I saw (nor blush to
          add,<br /> With ample recompense) giants and dwarfs,<br /> Clowns,
          conjurors, posture-masters, harlequins,<br /> Amid the uproar of the
          rabblement,<br /> Perform their feats. Nor was it mean delight<br /> To
          watch crude Nature work in untaught minds;<br /> To note the laws and
          progress of belief;<br /> Though obstinate on this way, yet on that<br />
          How willingly we travel, and how far!<br /> To have, for instance,
          brought upon the scene<br /> The champion, Jack the Giant-killer: Lo!<br />
          He dons his coat of darkness; on the stage<br /> Walks, and achieves
          his wonders, from the eye<br /> Of living Mortal covert, "as the moon<br />
          Hid in her vacant interlunar cave."<br /> Delusion bold! and how can it
          be wrought?<br /> The garb he wears is black as death, the word<br /> "<i>Invisible</i>"
          flames forth upon his chest.<br /> <br /> Here, too, were "forms and
          pressures of the time,"<br /> Rough, bold, as Grecian comedy displayed<br />
          When Art was young; dramas of living men,<br /> And recent things yet
          warm with life; a sea-fight,<br /> Shipwreck, or some domestic incident<br />
          Divulged by Truth and magnified by Fame,<br /> Such as the daring
          brotherhood of late<br /> Set forth, too serious theme for that light
          place&mdash;<br /> I mean, O distant Friend! a story drawn<br /> From
          our own ground,&mdash;the Maid of Buttermere,&mdash;<br /> And how,
          unfaithful to a virtuous wife<br /> Deserted and deceived, the spoiler
          came<br /> And wooed the artless daughter of the hills,<br /> And wedded
          her, in cruel mockery<br /> Of love and marriage bonds. These words to
          thee<br /> Must needs bring back the moment when we first,<br /> Ere the
          broad world rang with the maiden's name,<br /> Beheld her serving at
          the cottage inn,<br /> Both stricken, as she entered or withdrew,<br />
          With admiration of her modest mien<br /> And carriage, marked by
          unexampled grace.<br /> We since that time not unfamiliarly<br /> Have
          seen her,&mdash;her discretion have observed,<br /> Her just opinions,
          delicate reserve,<br /> Her patience, and humility of mind<br />
          Unspoiled by commendation and the excess<br /> Of public notice&mdash;an
          offensive light<br /> To a meek spirit suffering inwardly.<br /> <br />
          From this memorial tribute to my theme<br /> I was returning, when,
          with sundry forms<br /> Commingled&mdash;shapes which met me in the way<br />
          That we must tread&mdash;thy image rose again,<br /> Maiden of
          Buttermere! She lives in peace<br /> Upon the spot where she was born
          and reared;<br /> Without contamination doth she live<br /> In
          quietness, without anxiety:<br /> Beside the mountain chapel, sleeps in
          earth<br /> Her new-born infant, fearless as a lamb<br /> That, thither
          driven from some unsheltered place,<br /> Rests underneath the little
          rock-like pile<br /> When storms are raging. Happy are they both&mdash;<br />
          Mother and child!&mdash;These feelings, in themselves<br /> Trite, do
          yet scarcely seem so when I think<br /> On those ingenuous moments of
          our youth<br /> Ere we have learnt by use to slight the crimes<br /> And
          sorrows of the world. Those simple days<br /> Are now my theme; and,
          foremost of the scenes,<br /> Which yet survive in memory, appears<br />
          One, at whose centre sate a lovely Boy,<br /> A sportive infant, who,
          for six months' space,<br /> Not more, had been of age to deal about<br />
          Articulate prattle&mdash;Child as beautiful<br /> As ever clung around
          a mother's neck,<br /> Or father fondly gazed upon with pride.<br />
          There, too, conspicuous for stature tall<br /> And large dark eyes,
          beside her infant stood<br /> The mother; but, upon her cheeks
          diffused,<br /> False tints too well accorded with the glare<br /> From
          play-house lustres thrown without reserve<br /> On every object near.
          The Boy had been<br /> The pride and pleasure of all lookers-on<br /> In
          whatsoever place, but seemed in this<br /> A sort of alien scattered
          from the clouds.<br /> Of lusty vigour, more than infantine<br /> He was
          in limb, in cheek a summer rose<br /> Just three parts blown&mdash;a
          cottage-child&mdash;if e'er,<br /> By cottage-door on breezy mountain
          side,<br /> Or in some sheltering vale, was seen a babe<br /> By
          Nature's gifts so favoured. Upon a board<br /> Decked with refreshments
          had this child been placed,<br /> <i>His</i> little stage in the vast
          theatre,<br /> And there he sate surrounded with a throng<br /> Of
          chance spectators, chiefly dissolute men<br /> And shameless women,
          treated and caressed;<br /> Ate, drank, and with the fruit and glasses
          played,<br /> While oaths and laughter and indecent speech<br /> Were
          rife about him as the songs of birds<br /> Contending after showers.
          The mother now<br /> Is fading out of memory, but I see<br /> The lovely
          Boy as I beheld him then<br /> Among the wretched and the falsely gay,<br />
          Like one of those who walked with hair unsinged<br /> Amid the fiery
          furnace. Charms and spells<br /> Muttered on black and spiteful
          instigation<br /> Have stopped, as some believe, the kindliest growths.<br />
          Ah, with how different spirit might a prayer<br /> Have been preferred,
          that this fair creature, checked<br /> By special privilege of Nature's
          love,<br /> Should in his childhood be detained for ever!<br /> But with
          its universal freight the tide<br /> Hath rolled along, and this bright
          innocent,<br /> Mary! may now have lived till he could look<br /> With
          envy on thy nameless babe that sleeps,<br /> Beside the mountain
          chapel, undisturbed.<br /> <br /> Four rapid years had scarcely then
          been told<br /> Since, travelling southward from our pastoral hills,<br />
          I heard, and for the first time in my life,<br /> The voice of woman
          utter blasphemy&mdash;<br /> Saw woman as she is, to open shame<br />
          Abandoned, and the pride of public vice;<br /> I shuddered, for a
          barrier seemed at once<br /> Thrown in, that from humanity divorced<br />
          Humanity, splitting the race of man<br /> In twain, yet leaving the
          same outward form.<br /> Distress of mind ensued upon the sight<br />
          And ardent meditation. Later years<br /> Brought to such spectacle a
          milder sadness.<br /> Feelings of pure commiseration, grief<br /> For
          the individual and the overthrow<br /> Of her soul's beauty; farther I
          was then<br /> But seldom led, or wished to go; in truth<br /> The
          sorrow of the passion stopped me there.<br /> <br /> But let me now,
          less moved, in order take<br /> Our argument. Enough is said to show<br />
          How casual incidents of real life,<br /> Observed where pastime only
          had been sought,<br /> Outweighed, or put to flight, the set events<br />
          And measured passions of the stage, albeit<br /> By Siddons trod in the
          fulness of her power.<br /> Yet was the theatre my dear delight;<br />
          The very gilding, lamps and painted scrolls,<br /> And all the mean
          upholstery of the place,<br /> Wanted not animation, when the tide<br />
          Of pleasure ebbed but to return as fast<br /> With the ever-shifting
          figures of the scene,<br /> Solemn or gay: whether some beauteous dame<br />
          Advanced in radiance through a deep recess<br /> Of thick entangled
          forest, like the moon<br /> Opening the clouds; or sovereign king,
          announced<br /> With flourishing trumpet, came in full-blown state<br />
          Of the world's greatness, winding round with train<br /> Of courtiers,
          banners, and a length of guards;<br /> Or captive led in abject weeds,
          and jingling<br /> His slender manacles; or romping girl<br /> Bounced,
          leapt, and pawed the air; or mumbling sire,<br /> A scare-crow pattern
          of old age dressed up<br /> In all the tatters of infirmity<br /> All
          loosely put together, hobbled in,<br /> Stumping upon a cane with which
          he smites,<br /> From time to time, the solid boards, and makes them<br />
          Prate somewhat loudly of the whereabout<br /> Of one so overloaded with
          his years.<br /> But what of this! the laugh, the grin, grimace,<br />
          The antics striving to outstrip each other,<br /> Were all received,
          the least of them not lost,<br /> With an unmeasured welcome. Through
          the night,<br /> Between the show, and many-headed mass<br /> Of the
          spectators, and each several nook<br /> Filled with its fray or brawl,
          how eagerly<br /> And with what flashes, as it were, the mind<br />
          Turned this way&mdash;that way! sportive and alert<br /> And watchful,
          as a kitten when at play,<br /> While winds are eddying round her,
          among straws<br /> And rustling leaves. Enchanting age and sweet!<br />
          Romantic almost, looked at through a space,<br /> How small, of
          intervening years! For then,<br /> Though surely no mean progress had
          been made<br /> In meditations holy and sublime,<br /> Yet something of
          a girlish child-like gloss<br /> Of novelty survived for scenes like
          these;<br /> Enjoyment haply handed down from times<br /> When at a
          country-playhouse, some rude barn<br /> Tricked out for that proud use,
          if I perchance<br /> Caught, on a summer evening through a chink<br />
          In the old wall, an unexpected glimpse<br /> Of daylight, the bare
          thought of where I was<br /> Gladdened me more than if I had been led<br />
          Into a dazzling cavern of romance,<br /> Crowded with Genii busy among
          works<br /> Not to be looked at by the common sun.<br /> <br /> The
          matter that detains us now may seem,<br /> To many, neither dignified
          enough<br /> Nor arduous, yet will not be scorned by them,<br /> Who,
          looking inward, have observed the ties<br /> That bind the perishable
          hours of life<br /> Each to the other, and the curious props<br /> By
          which the world of memory and thought<br /> Exists and is sustained.
          More lofty themes,<br /> Such as at least do wear a prouder face,<br />
          Solicit our regard; but when I think<br /> Of these, I feel the
          imaginative power<br /> Languish within me; even then it slept,<br />
          When, pressed by tragic sufferings, the heart<br /> Was more than full;
          amid my sobs and tears<br /> It slept, even in the pregnant season of
          youth.<br /> For though I was most passionately moved<br /> And yielded
          to all changes of the scene<br /> With an obsequious promptness, yet
          the storm<br /> Passed not beyond the suburbs of the mind;<br /> Save
          when realities of act and mien,<br /> The incarnation of the spirits
          that move<br /> In harmony amid the Poet's world,<br /> Rose to ideal
          grandeur, or, called forth<br /> By power of contrast, made me
          recognise,<br /> As at a glance, the things which I had shaped,<br />
          And yet not shaped, had seen and scarcely seen,<br /> When, having
          closed the mighty Shakespeare's page,<br /> I mused, and thought, and
          felt, in solitude.<br /> <br /> Pass we from entertainments, that are
          such<br /> Professedly, to others titled higher,<br /> Yet, in the
          estimate of youth at least,<br /> More near akin to those than names
          imply,&mdash;<br /> I mean the brawls of lawyers in their courts<br />
          Before the ermined judge, or that great stage<br /> Where senators,
          tongue-favoured men, perform,<br /> Admired and envied. Oh! the beating
          heart,<br /> When one among the prime of these rose up,&mdash;<br />
          One, of whose name from childhood we had heard<br /> Familiarly, a
          household term, like those,<br /> The Bedfords, Glosters, Salsburys, of
          old<br /> Whom the fifth Harry talks of. Silence! hush!<br /> This is no
          trifler, no short-flighted wit,<br /> No stammerer of a minute,
          painfully<br /> Delivered. No! the Orator hath yoked<br /> The Hours,
          like young Aurora, to his car:<br /> Thrice welcome Presence! how can
          patience e'er<br /> Grow weary of attending on a track<br /> That
          kindles with such glory! All are charmed,<br /> Astonished; like a hero
          in romance,<br /> He winds away his never-ending horn;<br /> Words
          follow words, sense seems to follow sense:<br /> What memory and what
          logic! till the strain<br /> Transcendent, superhuman as it seemed,<br />
          Grows tedious even in a young man's ear.<br /> <br /> Genius of Burke!
          forgive the pen seduced<br /> By specious wonders, and too slow to tell<br />
          Of what the ingenuous, what bewildered men,<br /> Beginning to mistrust
          their boastful guides,<br /> And wise men, willing to grow wiser,
          caught,<br /> Rapt auditors! from thy most eloquent tongue&mdash;<br />
          Now mute, for ever mute in the cold grave.<br /> I see him,&mdash;old,
          but Vigorous in age,&mdash;<br /> Stand like an oak whose stag-horn
          branches start<br /> Out of its leafy brow, the more to awe<br /> The
          younger brethren of the grove. But some&mdash;<br /> While he
          forewarns, denounces, launches forth,<br /> Against all systems built
          on abstract rights,<br /> Keen ridicule; the majesty proclaims<br /> Of
          Institutes and Laws, hallowed by time;<br /> Declares the vital power
          of social ties<br /> Endeared by Custom; and with high disdain,<br />
          Exploding upstart Theory, insists<br /> Upon the allegiance to which
          men are born&mdash;<br /> Some&mdash;say at once a froward multitude&mdash;<br />
          Murmur (for truth is hated, where not loved)<br /> As the winds fret
          within the &AElig;olian cave,<br /> Galled by their monarch's chain.
          The times were big<br /> With ominous change, which, night by night,
          provoked<br /> Keen struggles, and black clouds of passion raised;<br />
          But memorable moments intervened,<br /> When Wisdom, like the Goddess
          from Jove's brain,<br /> Broke forth in armour of resplendent words,<br />
          Startling the Synod. Could a youth, and one<br /> In ancient story
          versed, whose breast had heaved<br /> Under the weight of classic
          eloquence,<br /> Sit, see, and hear, unthankful, uninspired?<br /> <br />
          Nor did the Pulpit's oratory fail<br /> To achieve its higher triumph.
          Not unfelt<br /> Were its admonishments, nor lightly heard<br /> The
          awful truths delivered thence by tongues<br /> Endowed with various
          power to search the soul;<br /> Yet ostentation, domineering, oft<br />
          Poured forth harangues, how sadly out of place!&mdash;<br /> There have
          I seen a comely bachelor,<br /> Fresh from a toilette of two hours,
          ascend<br /> His rostrum, with seraphic glance look up,<br /> And, in a
          tone elaborately low<br /> Beginning, lead his voice through many a
          maze<br /> A minuet course; and, winding up his mouth,<br /> From time
          to time, into an orifice<br /> Most delicate, a lurking eyelet, small,<br />
          And only not invisible, again<br /> Open it out, diffusing thence a
          smile<br /> Of rapt irradiation, exquisite.<br /> Meanwhile the
          Evangelists, Isaiah, Job,<br /> Moses, and he who penned, the other
          day,<br /> The Death of Abel, Shakespeare, and the Bard<br /> Whose
          genius spangled o'er a gloomy theme<br /> With fancies thick as his
          inspiring stars,<br /> And Ossian (doubt not, 'tis the naked truth)<br />
          Summoned from streamy Morven&mdash;each and all<br /> Would, in their
          turns, lend ornaments and flowers<br /> To entwine the crook of
          eloquence that helped<br /> This pretty Shepherd, pride of all the
          plains,<br /> To rule and guide his captivated flock.<br /> <br /> I
          glance but at a few conspicuous marks,<br /> Leaving a thousand others,
          that, in hall,<br /> Court, theatre, conventicle, or shop,<br /> In
          public room or private, park or street,<br /> Each fondly reared on his
          own pedestal,<br /> Looked out for admiration. Folly, vice,<br />
          Extravagance in gesture, mien, and dress,<br /> And all the strife of
          singularity,<br /> Lies to the ear, and lies to every sense&mdash;<br />
          Of these, and of the living shapes they wear,<br /> There is no end.
          Such candidates for regard,<br /> Although well pleased to be where
          they were found,<br /> I did not hunt after, nor greatly prize,<br />
          Nor made unto myself a secret boast<br /> Of reading them with quick
          and curious eye;<br /> But, as a common produce, things that are<br />
          To-day, to-morrow will be, took of them<br /> Such willing note, as, on
          some errand bound<br /> That asks not speed, a Traveller might bestow<br />
          On sea-shells that bestrew the sandy beach,<br /> Or daisies swarming
          through the fields of June.<br /> <br /> But foolishness and madness in
          parade,<br /> Though most at home in this their dear domain,<br /> Are
          scattered everywhere, no rarities,<br /> Even to the rudest novice of
          the Schools.<br /> Me, rather, it employed, to note, and keep<br /> In
          memory, those individual sights<br /> Of courage, or integrity, or
          truth,<br /> Or tenderness, which there, set off by foil,<br /> Appeared
          more touching. One will I select;<br /> A Father&mdash;for he bore that
          sacred name&mdash;<br /> Him saw I, sitting in an open square,<br />
          Upon a corner-stone of that low wall,<br /> Wherein were fixed the iron
          pales that fenced<br /> A spacious grass-plot; there, in silence, sate<br />
          This One Man, with a sickly babe outstretched<br /> Upon his knee, whom
          he had thither brought<br /> For sunshine, and to breathe the fresher
          air.<br /> Of those who passed, and me who looked at him,<br /> He took
          no heed; but in his brawny arms<br /> (The Artificer was to the elbow
          bare,<br /> And from his work this moment had been stolen)<br /> He held
          the child, and, bending over it,<br /> As if he were afraid both of the
          sun<br /> And of the air, which he had come to seek,<br /> Eyed the poor
          babe with love unutterable.<br /> <br /> As the black storm upon the
          mountain top<br /> Sets off the sunbeam in the valley, so<br /> That
          huge fermenting mass of human-kind<br /> Serves as a solemn
          back-ground, or relief,<br /> To single forms and objects, whence they
          draw,<br /> For feeling and contemplative regard,<br /> More than
          inherent liveliness and power.<br /> How oft, amid those overflowing
          streets,<br /> Have I gone forward with the crowd, and said<br /> Unto
          myself, "The face of every one<br /> That passes by me is a mystery!"<br />
          Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed<br /> By thoughts of
          what and whither, when and how,<br /> Until the shapes before my eyes
          became<br /> A second-sight procession, such as glides<br /> Over still
          mountains, or appears in dreams;<br /> And once, far-travelled in such
          mood, beyond<br /> The reach of common indication, lost<br /> Amid the
          moving pageant, I was smitten<br /> Abruptly, with the view (a sight
          not rare)<br /> Of a blind Beggar, who, with upright face,<br /> Stood,
          propped against a wall, upon his chest<br /> Wearing a written paper,
          to explain<br /> His story, whence he came, and who he was.<br /> Caught
          by the spectacle my mind turned round<br /> As with the might of
          waters; an apt type<br /> This label seemed of the utmost we can know,<br />
          Both of ourselves and of the universe;<br /> And, on the shape of that
          unmoving man,<br /> His steadfast face and sightless eyes, I gazed,<br />
          As if admonished from another world.<br /> <br /> Though reared upon the
          base of outward things,<br /> Structures like these the excited spirit
          mainly<br /> Builds for herself; scenes different there are,<br />
          Full-formed, that take, with small internal help,<br /> Possession of
          the faculties,&mdash;the peace<br /> That comes with night; the deep
          solemnity<br /> Of nature's intermediate hours of rest,<br /> When the
          great tide of human life stands still;<br /> The business of the day to
          come, unborn,<br /> Of that gone by, locked up, as in the grave;<br />
          The blended calmness of the heavens and earth,<br /> Moonlight and
          stars, and empty streets, and sounds<br /> Unfrequent as in deserts; at
          late hours<br /> Of winter evenings, when unwholesome rains<br /> Are
          falling hard, with people yet astir,<br /> The feeble salutation from
          the voice<br /> Of some unhappy woman, now and then<br /> Heard as we
          pass, when no one looks about,<br /> Nothing is listened to. But these,
          I fear,<br /> Are falsely catalogued; things that are, are not,<br /> As
          the mind answers to them, or the heart<br /> Is prompt, or slow, to
          feel. What say you, then,<br /> To times, when half the city shall
          break out<br /> Full of one passion, vengeance, rage, or fear?<br /> To
          executions, to a street on fire,<br /> Mobs, riots, or rejoicings? From
          these sights<br /> Take one,&mdash;that ancient festival, the Fair,<br />
          Holden where martyrs suffered in past time,<br /> And named of St.
          Bartholomew; there, see<br /> A work completed to our hands, that lays,<br />
          If any spectacle on earth can do,<br /> The whole creative powers of
          man asleep!&mdash;<br /> For once, the Muse's help will we implore,<br />
          And she shall lodge us, wafted on her wings,<br /> Above the press and
          danger of the crowd,<br /> Upon some showman's platform. What a shock<br />
          For eyes and ears! what anarchy and din,<br /> Barbarian and infernal,&mdash;a
          phantasma,<br /> Monstrous in colour, motion, shape, sight, sound!<br />
          Below, the open space, through every nook<br /> Of the wide area,
          twinkles, is alive<br /> With heads; the midway region, and above,<br />
          Is thronged with staring pictures and huge scrolls,<br /> Dumb
          proclamations of the Prodigies;<br /> With chattering monkeys dangling
          from their poles,<br /> And children whirling in their roundabouts;<br />
          With those that stretch the neck and strain the eyes,<br /> And crack
          the voice in rivalship, the crowd<br /> Inviting; with buffoons against
          buffoons<br /> Grimacing, writhing, screaming,&mdash;him who grinds<br />
          The hurdy-gurdy, at the fiddle weaves,<br /> Rattles the salt-box,
          thumps the kettle-drum,<br /> And him who at the trumpet puffs his
          cheeks,<br /> The silver-collared Negro with his timbrel,<br />
          Equestrians, tumblers, women, girls, and boys,<br /> Blue-breeched,
          pink-vested, with high-towering plumes.&mdash;<br /> All moveables of
          wonder, from all parts,<br /> Are here&mdash;Albinos, painted Indians,
          Dwarfs,<br /> The Horse of knowledge, and the learned Pig,<br /> The
          Stone-eater, the man that swallows fire,<br /> Giants, Ventriloquists,
          the Invisible Girl,<br /> The Bust that speaks and moves its goggling
          eyes,<br /> The Wax-work, Clock-work, all the marvellous craft<br /> Of
          modern Merlins, Wild Beasts, Puppet-shows,<br /> All out-o'-the-way,
          far-fetched, perverted things,<br /> All freaks of nature, all
          Promethean thoughts<br /> Of man, his dullness, madness, and their
          feats<br /> All jumbled up together, to compose<br /> A Parliament of
          Monsters. Tents and Booths<br /> Meanwhile, as if the whole were one
          vast mill,<br /> Are vomiting, receiving on all sides,<br /> Men, Women,
          three-years' Children, Babes in arms.<br /> <br /> Oh, blank confusion!
          true epitome<br /> Of what the mighty City is herself,<br /> To
          thousands upon thousands of her sons,<br /> Living amid the same
          perpetual whirl<br /> Of trivial objects, melted and reduced<br /> To
          one identity, by differences<br /> That have no law, no meaning, and no
          end&mdash;<br /> Oppression, under which even highest minds<br /> Must
          labour, whence the strongest are not free.<br /> But though the picture
          weary out the eye,<br /> By nature an unmanageable sight,<br /> It is
          not wholly so to him who looks<br /> In steadiness, who hath among
          least things<br /> An under-sense of greatest; sees the parts<br /> As
          parts, but with a feeling of the whole.<br /> This, of all
          acquisitions, first awaits<br /> On sundry and most widely different
          modes<br /> Of education, nor with least delight<br /> On that through
          which I passed. Attention springs,<br /> And comprehensiveness and
          memory flow,<br /> From early converse with the works of God<br /> Among
          all regions; chiefly where appear<br /> Most obviously simplicity and
          power.<br /> Think, how the everlasting streams and woods,<br />
          Stretched and still stretching far and wide, exalt<br /> The roving
          Indian, on his desert sands:<br /> What grandeur not unfelt, what
          pregnant show<br /> Of beauty, meets the sun-burnt Arab's eye:<br />
          And, as the sea propels, from zone to zone,<br /> Its currents;
          magnifies its shoals of life<br /> Beyond all compass; spreads, and
          sends aloft<br /> Armies of clouds,&mdash;even so, its powers and
          aspects<br /> Shape for mankind, by principles as fixed,<br /> The views
          and aspirations of the soul<br /> To majesty. Like virtue have the
          forms<br /> Perennial of the ancient hills; nor less<br /> The changeful
          language of their countenances<br /> Quickens the slumbering mind, and
          aids the thoughts,<br /> However multitudinous, to move<br /> With order
          and relation. This, if still,<br /> As hitherto, in freedom I may
          speak,<br /> Not violating any just restraint,<br /> As may be hoped, of
          real modesty,&mdash;<br /> This did I feel, in London's vast domain.<br />
          The Spirit of Nature was upon me there;<br /> The soul of Beauty and
          enduring Life<br /> Vouchsafed her inspiration, and diffused,<br />
          Through meagre lines and colours, and the press<br /> Of
          self-destroying, transitory things,<br /> Composure, and ennobling
          Harmony.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="#Ctoc">Contents&mdash;<i>The

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "As we were going along, we were stopped at once, at the distance
        perhaps of fifty yards from our favourite birch tree. It was yielding to
        the gusty wind with all its tender twigs. The sun shone upon it, and it
        glanced in the wind like a flying sunshiny shower. It was a tree in
        shape, with stem and branches, but it was like a spirit of water. The
        sun went in, and it resumed its purplish appearance, the twigs still
        yielding to the wind, but not so visibly to us. The other birch trees
        that were near it looked bright and cheerful, but it was a Creation by
        itself amongst them."

        named Hatfield, who called himself the Hon. Colonel Hope, brother of
        Lord Hopetoun, won her heart, and married her. Soon after the marriage,
        he was apprehended on a charge of forgery, surreptitiously franking a
        letter in the name of a Member of Parliament, tried at Carlisle,
        convicted, and hanged. It was discovered during the trial, that he had a
        wife and family, and had fled to these sequestered parts to escape the

      &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;"> In one of the MS. books in Dorothy
      Wordsworth's handwriting, on the outside leather cover of which is
      written, "May to December 1802," there are some lines which were evidently
      dictated to her, or copied by her, from the numerous experimental efforts
      of her brother in connection with this autobiographical poem. They are as
      follows:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'Shall he who gives his days to low pursuits<br /> Amid the
        undistinguishable crowd<br /> Of cities, 'mid the same eternal flow<br />
        Of the same objects, melted and reduced<br /> To one identity, by
        differences<br /> That have no law, no meaning, and no end,<br /> Shall he
        feel yearning to those lifeless forms,<br /> And shall we think that
        Nature is less kind<br /> To those, who all day long, through a busy
        life,<br /> Have walked within her sight? It cannot be.'

          What sounds are those, Helvellyn, that are heard<br /> Up to thy
          summit, through the depth of air<br /> Ascending, as if distance had
          the power<br /> To make the sounds more audible? What crowd<br />
          Covers, or sprinkles o'er, yon village green?<br /> Crowd seems it,
          solitary hill! to thee,<br /> Though but a little family of men,<br />
          Shepherds and tillers of the ground&mdash;betimes<br /> Assembled with
          their children and their wives,<br /> And here and there a stranger
          interspersed.<br /> They hold a rustic fair&mdash;a festival,<br /> Such
          as, on this side now, and now on that,<br /> Repeated through his
          tributary vales,<br /> Helvellyn, in the silence of his rest,<br /> Sees
          annually, if clouds towards either ocean<br /> Blown from their
          favourite resting-place, or mists<br /> Dissolved, have left him an
          unshrouded head.<br /> Delightful day it is for all who dwell<br /> In
          this secluded glen, and eagerly<br /> They give it welcome. Long ere
          heat of noon,<br /> From byre or field the kine were brought; the sheep<br />
          Are penned in cotes; the chaffering is begun.<br /> The heifer lows,
          uneasy at the voice<br /> Of a new master; bleat the flocks aloud.<br />
          Booths are there none; a stall or two is here;<br /> A lame man or a
          blind, the one to beg,<br /> The other to make music; hither, too,<br />
          From far, with basket, slung upon her arm,<br /> Of hawker's wares&mdash;books,
          pictures, combs, and pins&mdash;<br /> Some aged woman finds her way
          again,<br /> Year after year, a punctual visitant!<br /> There also
          stands a speech-maker by rote,<br /> Pulling the strings of his boxed
          raree-show;<br /> And in the lapse of many years may come<br /> Prouder
          itinerant, mountebank, or he<br /> Whose wonders in a covered wain lie
          hid.<br /> But one there is, the loveliest of them all,<br /> Some sweet
          lass of the valley, looking out<br /> For gains, and who that sees her
          would not buy?<br /> Fruits of her father's orchard, are her wares,<br />
          And with the ruddy produce, she walks round<br /> Among the crowd, half
          pleased with, half ashamed<br /> Of her new office, blushing
          restlessly.<br /> The children now are rich, for the old to-day<br />
          Are generous as the young; and, if content<br /> With looking on, some
          ancient wedded pair<br /> Sit in the shade together, while they gaze,<br />
          "A cheerful smile unbends the wrinkled brow,<br /> The days departed
          start again to life,<br /> And all the scenes of childhood reappear,<br />
          Faint, but more tranquil, like the changing sun<br /> To him who slept
          at noon and wakes at eve."<br /> Thus gaiety and cheerfulness prevail,<br />
          Spreading from young to old, from old to young,<br /> And no one seems
          to want his share.&mdash;Immense<br /> Is the recess, the circumambient
          world<br /> Magnificent, by which they are embraced:<br /> They move
          about upon the soft green turf:<br /> How little they, they and their
          doings, seem,<br /> And all that they can further or obstruct!<br />
          Through utter weakness pitiably dear,<br /> As tender infants are: and
          yet how great!<br /> For all things serve them: them the morning light<br />
          Loves, as it glistens on the silent rocks;<br /> And them the silent
          rocks, which now from high<br /> Look down upon them; the reposing
          clouds;<br /> The wild brooks prattling from invisible haunts;<br /> And
          old Helvellyn, conscious of the stir<br /> Which animates this day
          their calm abode.<br /> <br /> With deep devotion, Nature, did I feel,<br />
          In that enormous City's turbulent world<br /> Of men and things, what
          benefit I owed<br /> To thee, and those domains of rural peace,<br />
          Where to the sense of beauty first my heart<br /> Was opened; tract
          more exquisitely fair<br /> Than that famed paradise often thousand
          trees,<br /> Or Gehol's matchless gardens, for delight<br /> Of the
          Tartarian dynasty composed<br /> (Beyond that mighty wall, not
          fabulous,<br /> China's stupendous mound) by patient toil<br /> Of
          myriads and boon nature's lavish help;<br /> There, in a clime from
          widest empire chosen,<br /> Fulfilling (could enchantment have done
          more?)<br /> A sumptuous dream of flowery lawns, with domes<br /> Of
          pleasure sprinkled over, shady dells<br /> For eastern monasteries,
          sunny mounts<br /> With temples crested, bridges, gondolas,<br /> Rocks,
          dens, and groves of foliage taught to melt<br /> Into each other their
          obsequious hues,<br /> Vanished and vanishing in subtle chase,<br /> Too
          fine to be pursued; or standing forth<br /> In no discordant
          opposition, strong<br /> And gorgeous as the colours side by side<br />
          Bedded among rich plumes of tropic birds;<br /> And mountains over all,
          embracing all;<br /> And all the landscape, endlessly enriched<br />
          With waters running, falling, or asleep.<br /> <br /> But lovelier far
          than this, the paradise<br /> Where I was reared; in Nature's primitive
          gifts<br /> Favoured no less, and more to every sense<br /> Delicious,
          seeing that the sun and sky,<br /> The elements, and seasons as they
          change,<br /> Do find a worthy fellow-labourer there&mdash;<br /> Man
          free, man working for himself, with choice<br /> Of time, and place,
          and object; by his wants,<br /> His comforts, native occupations,
          cares,<br /> Cheerfully led to individual ends<br /> Or social, and
          still followed by a train<br /> Unwooed, unthought-of even&mdash;simplicity,<br />
          And beauty, and inevitable grace.<br /> <br /> Yea, when a glimpse of
          those imperial bowers<br /> Would to a child be transport over-great,<br />
          When but a half-hour's roam through such a place<br /> Would leave
          behind a dance of images,<br /> That shall break in upon his sleep for
          weeks;<br /> Even then the common haunts of the green earth,<br /> And
          ordinary interests of man,<br /> Which they embosom, all without regard<br />
          As both may seem, are fastening on the heart<br /> Insensibly, each
          with the other's help.<br /> For me, when my affections first were led<br />
          From kindred, friends, and playmates, to partake<br /> Love for the
          human creature's absolute self,<br /> That noticeable kindliness of
          heart<br /> Sprang out of fountains, there abounding most<br /> Where
          sovereign Nature dictated the tasks<br /> And occupations which her
          beauty adorned,<br /> And Shepherds were the men that pleased me first;<br />
          Not such as Saturn ruled 'mid Latian wilds,<br /> With arts and laws so
          tempered, that their lives<br /> Left, even to us toiling in this late
          day,<br /> A bright tradition of the golden age;<br /> Not such as, 'mid
          Arcadian fastnesses<br /> Sequestered, handed down among themselves<br />
          Felicity, in Grecian song renowned;<br /> Nor such as&mdash;when an
          adverse fate had driven,<br /> From house and home, the courtly band
          whose fortunes<br /> Entered, with Shakespeare's genius, the wild woods<br />
          Of Arden&mdash;amid sunshine or in shade,<br /> Culled the best fruits
          of Time's uncounted hours,<br /> Ere Phoebe sighed for the false
          Ganymede;<br /> Or there where Perdita and Florizel<br /> Together
          danced, Queen of the feast, and King;<br /> Nor such as Spenser fabled.
          True it is,<br /> That I had heard (what he perhaps had seen)<br /> Of
          maids at sunrise bringing in from far<br /> Their May-bush, and along
          the streets in flocks<br /> Parading with a song of taunting rhymes,<br />
          Aimed at the laggards slumbering within doors;<br /> Had also heard,
          from those who yet remembered,<br /> Tales of the May-pole dance, and
          wreaths that decked<br /> Porch, door-way, or kirk-pillar; and of
          youths,<br /> Each with his maid, before the sun was up,<br /> By annual
          custom, issuing forth in troops,<br /> To drink the waters of some
          sainted well,<br /> And hang it round with garlands. Love survives;<br />
          But, for such purpose, flowers no longer grow:<br /> The times, too
          sage, perhaps too proud, have dropped<br /> These lighter graces; and
          the rural ways<br /> And manners which my childhood looked upon<br />
          Were the unluxuriant produce of a life<br /> Intent on little but
          substantial needs,<br /> Yet rich in beauty, beauty that was felt.<br />
          But images of danger and distress,<br /> Man suffering among awful
          Powers and Forms;<br /> Of this I heard, and saw enough to make<br />
          Imagination restless; nor was free<br /> Myself from frequent perils;
          nor were tales<br /> Wanting,&mdash;the tragedies of former times,<br />
          Hazards and strange escapes, of which the rocks<br /> Immutable and
          overflowing streams,<br /> Where'er I roamed, were speaking monuments.<br />
          <br /> Smooth life had flock and shepherd in old time,<br /> Long
          springs and tepid winters, on the banks<br /> Of delicate Galesus; and
          no less<br /> Those scattered along Adria's myrtle shores:<br /> Smooth
          life had herdsman, and his snow-white herd<br /> To triumphs and to
          sacrificial rites<br /> Devoted, on the inviolable stream<br /> Of rich
          Clitumnus; and the goat-herd lived<br /> As calmly, underneath the
          pleasant brows<br /> Of cool Lucretilis, where the pipe was heard<br />
          Of Pan, Invisible God, thrilling the rocks<br /> With tutelary music,
          from all harm<br /> The fold protecting. I myself, mature<br /> In
          manhood then, have seen a pastoral tract<br /> Like one of these, where
          Fancy might run wild,<br /> Though under skies less generous, less
          serene:<br /> There, for her own delight had Nature framed<br /> A
          pleasure-ground, diffused a fair expanse<br /> Of level pasture,
          islanded with groves<br /> And banked with woody risings; but the Plain<br />
          Endless, here opening widely out, and there<br /> Shut up in lesser
          lakes or beds of lawn<br /> And intricate recesses, creek or bay<br />
          Sheltered within a shelter, where at large<br /> The shepherd strays, a
          rolling hut his home.<br /> Thither he comes with spring-time, there
          abides<br /> All summer, and at sunrise ye may hear<br /> His flageolet
          to liquid notes of love<br /> Attuned, or sprightly fife resounding
          far.<br /> Nook is there none, nor tract of that vast space<br /> Where
          passage opens, but the same shall have<br /> In turn its visitant,
          telling there his hours<br /> In unlaborious pleasure, with no task<br />
          More toilsome than to carve a beechen bowl<br /> For spring or
          fountain, which the traveller finds,<br /> When through the region he
          pursues at will<br /> His devious course. A glimpse of such sweet life<br />
          I saw when, from the melancholy walls<br /> Of Goslar, once imperial, I
          renewed<br /> My daily walk along that wide champaign,<br /> That,
          reaching to her gates, spreads east and west,<br /> And northwards,
          from beneath the mountainous verge<br /> Of the Hercynian forest, Yet,
          hail to you<br /> Moors, mountains, headlands, and ye hollow vales,<br />
          Ye long deep channels for the Atlantic's voice,<br /> Powers of my
          native region! Ye that seize<br /> The heart with firmer grasp! Your
          snows and streams<br /> Ungovernable, and your terrifying winds,<br />
          That howl so dismally for him who treads<br /> Companionless your awful
          solitudes!<br /> There, 'tis the shepherd's task the winter long<br />
          To wait upon the storms: of their approach<br /> Sagacious, into
          sheltering coves he drives<br /> His flock, and thither from the
          homestead bears<br /> A toilsome burden up the craggy ways,<br /> And
          deals it out, their regular nourishment<br /> Strewn on the frozen
          snow. And when the spring<br /> Looks out, and all the pastures dance
          with lambs,<br /> And when the flock, with warmer weather, climbs<br />
          Higher and higher, him his office leads<br /> To watch their goings,
          whatsoever track<br /> The wanderers choose. For this he quits his home<br />
          At day-spring, and no sooner doth the sun<br /> Begin to strike him
          with a fire-like heat,<br /> Than he lies down upon some shining rock,<br />
          And breakfasts with his dog. When they have stolen,<br /> As is their
          wont, a pittance from strict time,<br /> For rest not needed or
          exchange of love,<br /> Then from his couch he starts; and now his feet<br />
          Crush out a livelier fragrance from the flowers<br /> Of lowly thyme,
          by Nature's skill enwrought<br /> In the wild turf: the lingering dews
          of morn<br /> Smoke round him, as from hill to hill he hies,<br /> His
          staff protending like a hunter's spear,<br /> Or by its aid leaping
          from crag to crag,<br /> And o'er the brawling beds of unbridged
          streams.<br /> Philosophy, methinks, at Fancy's call,<br /> Might deign
          to follow him through what he does<br /> Or sees in his day's march;
          himself he feels,<br /> In those vast regions where his service lies,<br />
          A freeman, wedded to his life of hope<br /> And hazard, and hard labour
          interchanged<br /> With that majestic indolence so dear<br /> To native
          man. A rambling school-boy, thus<br /> I felt his presence in his own
          domain,<br /> As of a lord and master, or a power,<br /> Or genius,
          under Nature, under God,<br /> Presiding; and severest solitude<br />
          Had more commanding looks when he was there.<br /> When up the lonely
          brooks on rainy days<br /> Angling I went, or trod the trackless hills<br />
          By mists bewildered, suddenly mine eyes<br /> Have glanced upon him
          distant a few steps,<br /> In size a giant, stalking through thick fog,<br />
          His sheep like Greenland bears; or, as he stepped<br /> Beyond the
          boundary line of some hill-shadow,<br /> His form hath flashed upon me,
          glorified<br /> By the deep radiance of the setting sun:<br /> Or him
          have I descried in distant sky,<br /> A solitary object and sublime,<br />
          Above all height! like an aerial cross<br /> Stationed alone upon a
          spiry rock<br /> Of the Chartreuse, for worship. Thus was man<br />
          Ennobled outwardly before my sight,<br /> And thus my heart was early
          introduced<br /> To an unconscious love and reverence<br /> Of human
          nature; hence the human form<br /> To me became an index of delight,<br />
          Of grace and honour, power and worthiness.<br /> Meanwhile this
          creature&mdash;spiritual almost<br /> As those of books, but more
          exalted far;<br /> Far more of an imaginative form<br /> Than the gay
          Corin of the groves, who lives<br /> For his own fancies, or to dance
          by the hour,<br /> In coronal, with Phyllis in the midst&mdash;<br />
          Was, for the purposes of kind, a man<br /> With the most common;
          husband, father; learned,<br /> Could teach, admonish; suffered with
          the rest<br /> From vice and folly, wretchedness and fear;<br /> Of this
          I little saw, cared less for it,<br /> But something must have felt.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Call ye these appearances<br /> Which I beheld of shepherds in my
          youth,<br /> This sanctity of Nature given to man,<br /> A shadow, a
          delusion? ye who pore<br /> On the dead letter, miss the spirit of
          things;<br /> Whose truth is not a motion or a shape<br /> Instinct with
          vital functions, but a block<br /> Or waxen image which yourselves have
          made,<br /> And ye adore! But blessed be the God<br /> Of Nature and of
          Man that this was so;<br /> That men before my inexperienced eyes<br />
          Did first present themselves thus purified,<br /> Removed, and to a
          distance that was fit:<br /> And so we all of us in some degree<br />
          Are led to knowledge, wheresoever led,<br /> And howsoever; were it
          otherwise,<br /> And we found evil fast as we find good<br /> In our
          first years, or think that it is found,<br /> How could the innocent
          heart bear up and live!<br /> But doubly fortunate my lot; not here<br />
          Alone, that something of a better life<br /> Perhaps was round me than
          it is the privilege<br /> Of most to move in, but that first I looked<br />
          At Man through objects that were great or fair;<br /> First communed
          with him by their help. And thus<br /> Was founded a sure safeguard and
          defence<br /> Against the weight of meanness, selfish cares,<br />
          Coarse manners, vulgar passions, that beat in<br /> On all sides from
          the ordinary world<br /> In which we traffic. Starting from this point<br />
          I had my face turned toward the truth, began<br /> With an advantage
          furnished by that kind<br /> Of prepossession, without which the soul<br />
          Receives no knowledge that can bring forth good,<br /> No genuine
          insight ever comes to her.<br /> From the restraint of over-watchful
          eyes<br /> Preserved, I moved about, year after year,<br /> Happy, and
          now most thankful that my walk<br /> Was guarded from too early
          intercourse<br /> With the deformities of crowded life,<br /> And those
          ensuing laughters and contempts,<br /> Self-pleasing, which, if we
          would wish to think<br /> With a due reverence on earth's rightful
          lord,<br /> Here placed to be the inheritor of heaven,<br /> Will not
          permit us; but pursue the mind,<br /> That to devotion willingly would
          rise,<br /> Into the temple and the temple's heart.<br /> <br /> Yet deem
          not, Friend! that human kind with me<br /> Thus early took a place
          pre-eminent;<br /> Nature herself was, at this unripe time,<br /> But
          secondary to my own pursuits<br /> And animal activities, and all<br />
          Their trivial pleasures; and when these had drooped<br /> And gradually
          expired, and Nature, prized<br /> For her own sake, became my joy, even
          then&mdash;<br /> And upwards through late youth, until not less<br />
          Than two-and-twenty summers had been told&mdash;<br /> Was Man in my
          affections and regards<br /> Subordinate to her, her visible forms<br />
          And viewless agencies: a passion, she,<br /> A rapture often, and
          immediate love<br /> Ever at hand; he, only a delight<br /> Occasional,
          an accidental grace,<br /> His hour being not yet come. Far less had
          then<br /> The inferior creatures, beast or bird, attuned<br /> My
          spirit to that gentleness of love<br /> (Though they had long been
          carefully observed),<br /> Won from me those minute obeisances<br /> Of
          tenderness, which I may number now<br /> With my first blessings.
          Nevertheless, on these<br /> The light of beauty did not fall in vain,<br />
          Or grandeur circumfuse them to no end.<br /> <br /> But when that first
          poetic faculty<br /> Of plain Imagination and severe,<br /> No longer a
          mute influence of the soul,<br /> Ventured, at some rash Muse's earnest
          call,<br /> To try her strength among harmonious words;<br /> And to
          book-notions and the rules of art<br /> Did knowingly conform itself;
          there came<br /> Among the simple shapes of human life<br /> A
          wilfulness of fancy and conceit;<br /> And Nature and her objects
          beautified<br /> These fictions, as in some sort, in their turn,<br />
          They burnished her. From touch of this new power<br /> Nothing was
          safe: the elder-tree that grew<br /> Beside the well-known
          charnel-house had then<br /> A dismal look: the yew-tree had its ghost,<br />
          That took his station there for ornament:<br /> The dignities of plain
          occurrence then<br /> Were tasteless, and truth's golden mean, a point<br />
          Where no sufficient pleasure could be found.<br /> Then, if a widow,
          staggering with the blow<br /> Of her distress, was known to have
          turned her steps<br /> To the cold grave in which her husband slept,<br />
          One night, or haply more than one, through pain<br /> Or half-insensate
          impotence of mind,<br /> The fact was caught at greedily, and there<br />
          She must be visitant the whole year through,<br /> Wetting the turf
          with never-ending tears.<br /> <br /> Through quaint obliquities I might
          pursue<br /> These cravings; when the fox-glove, one by one,<br />
          Upwards through every stage of the tall stem,<br /> Had shed beside the
          public way its bells,<br /> And stood of all dismantled, save the last<br />
          Left at the tapering ladder's top, that seemed<br /> To bend as doth a
          slender blade of grass<br /> Tipped with a rain-drop, Fancy loved to
          seat,<br /> Beneath the plant despoiled, but crested still<br /> With
          this last relic, soon itself to fall,<br /> Some vagrant mother, whose
          arch little ones,<br /> All unconcerned by her dejected plight,<br />
          Laughed as with rival eagerness their hands<br /> Gathered the purple
          cups that round them lay,<br /> Strewing the turf's green slope.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          A diamond light<br /> (Whene'er the summer sun, declining, smote<br /> A
          smooth rock wet with constant springs) was seen<br /> Sparkling from
          out a copse-clad bank that rose<br /> Fronting our cottage. Oft beside
          the hearth<br /> Seated, with open door, often and long<br /> Upon this
          restless lustre have I gazed,<br /> That made my fancy restless as
          itself.<br /> 'Twas now for me a burnished silver shield<br /> Suspended
          over a knight's tomb, who lay<br /> Inglorious, buried in the dusky
          wood:<br /> An entrance now into some magic cave<br /> Or palace built
          by fairies of the rock;<br /> Nor could I have been bribed to
          disenchant<br /> The spectacle, by visiting the spot.<br /> Thus wilful
          Fancy, in no hurtful mood,<br /> Engrafted far-fetched shapes on
          feelings bred<br /> By pure Imagination: busy Power<br /> She was, and
          with her ready pupil turned<br /> Instinctively to human passions, then<br />
          Least understood. Yet, 'mid the fervent swarm<br /> Of these vagaries,
          with an eye so rich<br /> As mine was through the bounty of a grand<br />
          And lovely region, I had forms distinct<br /> To steady me: each airy
          thought revolved<br /> Round a substantial centre, which at once<br />
          Incited it to motion, and controlled.<br /> I did not pine like one in
          cities bred,<br /> As was thy melancholy lot, dear Friend!<br /> Great
          Spirit as thou art, in endless dreams<br /> Of sickliness, disjoining,
          joining, things<br /> Without the light of knowledge. Where the harm,<br />
          If, when the woodman languished with disease<br /> Induced by sleeping
          nightly on the ground<br /> Within his sod-built cabin, Indian-wise,<br />
          I called the pangs of disappointed love,<br /> And all the sad etcetera
          of the wrong,<br /> To help him to his grave? Meanwhile the man,<br />
          If not already from the woods retired<br /> To die at home, was haply
          as I knew,<br /> Withering by slow degrees, 'mid gentle airs,<br />
          Birds, running streams, and hills so beautiful<br /> On golden
          evenings, while the charcoal pile<br /> Breathed up its smoke, an image
          of his ghost<br /> Or spirit that full soon must take her flight.<br />
          Nor shall we not be tending towards that point<br /> Of sound humanity
          to which our Tale<br /> Leads, though by sinuous ways, if here I shew<br />
          How Fancy, in a season when she wove<br /> Those slender cords, to
          guide the unconscious Boy<br /> For the Man's sake, could feed at
          Nature's call<br /> Some pensive musings which might well beseem<br />
          Maturer years.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A grove there is whose boughs<br /> Stretch from the
          western marge of Thurston-mere,<br /> With length of shade so thick,
          that whoso glides<br /> Along the line of low-roofed water, moves<br />
          As in a cloister. Once&mdash;while, in that shade<br /> Loitering, I
          watched the golden beams of light<br /> Flung from the setting sun, as
          they reposed<br /> In silent beauty on the naked ridge<br /> Of a high
          eastern hill&mdash;thus flowed my thoughts<br /> In a pure stream of
          words fresh from the heart:<br /> Dear native Regions, wheresoe'er
          shall close<br /> My mortal course, there will I think on you;<br />
          Dying, will cast on you a backward look;<br /> Even as this setting sun
          (albeit the Vale<br /> Is no where touched by one memorial gleam)<br />
          Doth with the fond remains of his last power<br /> Still linger, and a
          farewell lustre sheds<br /> On the dear mountain-tops where first he
          rose.<br /> <br /> Enough of humble arguments; recal,<br /> My Song!
          those high emotions which thy voice<br /> Has heretofore made known;
          that bursting forth<br /> Of sympathy, inspiring and inspired,<br />
          When everywhere a vital pulse was felt,<br /> And all the several
          frames of things, like stars,<br /> Through every magnitude
          distinguishable,<br /> Shone mutually indebted, or half lost<br /> Each
          in the other's blaze, a galaxy<br /> Of life and glory. In the midst
          stood Man,<br /> Outwardly, inwardly contemplated,<br /> As, of all
          visible natures, crown, though born<br /> Of dust, and kindred to the
          worm; a Being,<br /> Both in perception and discernment, first<br /> In
          every capability of rapture,<br /> Through the divine effect of power
          and love;<br /> As, more than anything we know, instinct<br /> With
          godhead, and, by reason and by will,<br /> Acknowledging dependency
          sublime.<br /> <br /> Ere long, the lonely mountains left, I moved,<br />
          Begirt, from day to day, with temporal shapes<br /> Of vice and folly
          thrust upon my view,<br /> Objects of sport, and ridicule, and scorn,<br />
          Manners and characters discriminate,<br /> And little bustling passions
          that eclipse,<br /> As well they might, the impersonated thought,<br />
          The idea, or abstraction of the kind.<br /> <br /> An idler among
          academic bowers,<br /> Such was my new condition, as at large<br /> Has
          been set forth; yet here the vulgar light<br /> Of present, actual,
          superficial life,<br /> Gleaming through colouring of other times,<br />
          Old usages and local privilege,<br /> Was welcome, softened, if not
          solemnised.<br /> <br /> This notwithstanding, being brought more near<br />
          To vice and guilt, forerunning wretchedness<br /> I trembled,&mdash;thought,
          at times, of human life<br /> With an indefinite terror and dismay,<br />
          Such as the storms and angry elements<br /> Had bred in me; but
          gloomier far, a dim<br /> Analogy to uproar and misrule,<br /> Disquiet,
          danger, and obscurity.<br /> <br /> It might be told (but wherefore
          speak of things<br /> Common to all?) that, seeing, I was led<br />
          Gravely to ponder&mdash;judging between good<br /> And evil, not as for
          the mind's delight<br /> But for her guidance&mdash;one who was to <i>act</i>,<br />
          As sometimes to the best of feeble means<br /> I did, by human sympathy
          impelled:<br /> And, through dislike and most offensive pain,<br /> Was
          to the truth conducted; of this faith<br /> Never forsaken, that, by
          acting well,<br /> And understanding, I should learn to love<br /> The
          end of life, and every thing we know.<br /> <br /> Grave Teacher, stern
          Preceptress! for at times<br /> Thou canst put on an aspect most
          severe;<br /> London, to thee I willingly return.<br /> Erewhile my
          verse played idly with the flowers<br /> Enwrought upon thy mantle;
          satisfied<br /> With that amusement, and a simple look<br /> Of
          child-like inquisition now and then<br /> Cast upwards on thy
          countenance, to detect<br /> Some inner meanings which might harbour
          there.<br /> But how could I in mood so light indulge,<br /> Keeping
          such fresh remembrance of the day,<br /> When, having thridded the long
          labyrinth<br /> Of the suburban villages, I first<br /> Entered thy vast
          dominion? On the roof<br /> Of an itinerant vehicle I sate,<br /> With
          vulgar men about me, trivial forms<br /> Of houses, pavement, streets,
          of men and things,&mdash;<br /> Mean shapes on every side: but, at the
          instant,<br /> When to myself it fairly might be said,<br /> The
          threshold now is overpast, (how strange<br /> That aught external to
          the living mind<br /> Should have such mighty sway! yet so it was),<br />
          A weight of ages did at once descend<br /> Upon my heart; no thought
          embodied, no<br /> Distinct remembrances, but weight and power,&mdash;<br />
          Power growing under weight: alas! I feel<br /> That I am trifling:
          'twas a moment's pause,&mdash;<br /> All that took place within me came
          and went<br /> As in a moment; yet with Time it dwells,<br /> And
          grateful memory, as a thing divine.<br /> <br /> The curious traveller,
          who, from open day,<br /> Hath passed with torches into some huge cave,<br />
          The Grotto of Antiparos, or the Den<br /> In old time haunted by that
          Danish Witch,<br /> Yordas; he looks around and sees the vault<br />
          Widening on all sides; sees, or thinks he sees,<br /> Erelong, the
          massy roof above his head,<br /> That instantly unsettles and recedes,&mdash;<br />
          Substance and shadow, light and darkness, all<br /> Commingled, making
          up a canopy<br /> Of shapes and forms and tendencies to shape<br /> That
          shift and vanish, change and interchange<br /> Like spectres,&mdash;ferment
          silent and sublime!<br /> That after a short space works less and less,<br />
          Till, every effort, every motion gone,<br /> The scene before him
          stands in perfect view<br /> Exposed, and lifeless as a written book!&mdash;<br />
          But let him pause awhile, and look again,<br /> And a new quickening
          shall succeed, at first<br /> Beginning timidly, then creeping fast,<br />
          Till the whole cave, so late a senseless mass,<br /> Busies the eye
          with images and forms<br /> Boldly assembled,&mdash;here is shadowed
          forth<br /> From the projections, wrinkles, cavities,<br /> A variegated
          landscape,&mdash;there the shape<br /> Of some gigantic warrior clad in
          mail,<br /> The ghostly semblance of a hooded monk.<br /> Veiled nun, or
          pilgrim resting on his staff:<br /> Strange congregation! yet not slow
          to meet<br /> Eyes that perceive through minds that can inspire.<br />
          <br /> Even in such sort had I at first been moved,<br /> Nor otherwise
          continued to be moved,<br /> As I explored the vast metropolis,<br />
          Fount of my country's destiny and the world's;<br /> That great
          emporium, chronicle at once<br /> And burial-place of passions, and
          their home<br /> Imperial, their chief living residence.<br /> <br />
          With strong sensations teeming as it did<br /> Of past and present,
          such a place must needs<br /> Have pleased me, seeking knowledge at
          that time<br /> Far less than craving power; yet knowledge came,<br />
          Sought or unsought, and influxes of power<br /> Came, of themselves, or
          at her call derived<br /> In fits of kindliest apprehensiveness,<br />
          From all sides, when whate'er was in itself<br /> Capacious found, or
          seemed to find, in me<br /> A correspondent amplitude of mind;<br />
          Such is the strength and glory of our youth!<br /> The human nature
          unto which I felt<br /> That I belonged, and reverenced with love,<br />
          Was not a punctual presence, but a spirit<br /> Diffused through time
          and space, with aid derived<br /> Of evidence from monuments, erect,<br />
          Prostrate, or leaning towards their common rest<br /> In earth, the
          widely scattered wreck sublime<br /> Of vanished nations, or more
          clearly drawn<br /> From books and what they picture and record.<br />
          <br /> 'Tis true, the history of our native land,<br /> With those of
          Greece compared and popular Rome,<br /> And in our high-wrought modern
          narratives<br /> Stript of their harmonising soul, the life<br /> Of
          manners and familiar incidents,<br /> Had never much delighted me. And
          less<br /> Than other intellects had mine been used<br /> To lean upon
          extrinsic circumstance<br /> Of record or tradition; but a sense<br />
          Of what in the Great City had been done<br /> And suffered, and was
          doing, suffering, still,<br /> Weighed with me, could support the test
          of thought;<br /> And, in despite of all that had gone by,<br /> Or was
          departing never to return,<br /> There I conversed with majesty and
          power<br /> Like independent natures. Hence the place<br /> Was thronged
          with impregnations like the Wilds<br /> In which my early feelings had
          been nursed&mdash;<br /> Bare hills and valleys, full of caverns,
          rocks,<br /> And audible seclusions, dashing lakes,<br /> Echoes and
          waterfalls, and pointed crags<br /> That into music touch the passing
          wind.<br /> Here then my young imagination found<br /> No uncongenial
          element; could here<br /> Among new objects serve or give command,<br />
          Even as the heart's occasions might require,<br /> To forward reason's
          else too scrupulous march.<br /> The effect was, still more elevated
          views<br /> Of human nature. Neither vice nor guilt,<br /> Debasement
          undergone by body or mind,<br /> Nor all the misery forced upon my
          sight,<br /> Misery not lightly passed, but sometimes scanned<br /> Most
          feelingly, could overthrow my trust<br /> In what we <i>may</i> become;
          induce belief<br /> That I was ignorant, had been falsely taught,<br />
          A solitary, who with vain conceits<br /> Had been inspired, and walked
          about in dreams.<br /> From those sad scenes when meditation turned,<br />
          Lo! every thing that was indeed divine<br /> Retained its purity
          inviolate,<br /> Nay brighter shone, by this portentous gloom<br /> Set
          off; such opposition as aroused<br /> The mind of Adam, yet in Paradise<br />
          Though fallen from bliss, when in the East he saw<br /> Darkness ere
          day's mid course, and morning light<br /> More orient in the western
          cloud, that drew<br /> O'er the blue firmament a radiant white,<br />
          Descending slow with something heavenly fraught.<br /> Add also, that
          among the multitudes<br /> Of that huge city, oftentimes was seen<br />
          Affectingly set forth, more than elsewhere<br /> Is possible, the unity
          of man,<br /> One spirit over ignorance and vice<br /> Predominant, in
          good and evil hearts;<br /> One sense for moral judgments, as one eye<br />
          For the sun's light. The soul when smitten thus<br /> By a sublime <i>idea</i>,
          whencesoe'er<br /> Vouchsafed for union or communion, feeds<br /> On the
          pure bliss, and takes her rest with God.<br /> Thus from a very early
          age, O Friend!<br /> My thoughts by slow gradations had been drawn<br />
          To human-kind, and to the good and ill<br /> Of human life: Nature had
          led me on;<br /> And oft amid the "busy hum" I seemed<br /> To travel
          independent of her help,<br /> As if I had forgotten her; but no,<br />
          The world of human-kind outweighed not hers<br /> In my habitual
          thoughts; the scale of love,<br /> Though filling daily, still was
          light, compared<br /> With that in which <i>her</i> mighty objects lay.<br />

      days' journey, and its length sixty. Strabo (iv. p. 292) included within
      the Hercynia Silva all the mountains of southern and central Germany, from
      the Danube to Transylvania. Later, it was limited to the mountains round
      Bohemia and extending to Hungary. (See Tacitus, <i>Germania</i>, 28, 30;
      and Pliny, <i>Historia Naturalis</i>, iv. 25, 28.) A trace of the ancient
      name is retained in the <i>Harz</i> mountains, which are clothed
      everywhere with conifers, Harz=resin.&mdash;Ed.</span><br /> <a

      with constant springs" and the "copse-clad bank" were. There is no
      copse-clad bank fronting Anne Tyson's cottage at Hawkshead. It may have
      been a rock on the wooded slope of the rounded hill that rises west of
      Cowper Ground, north-west of Hawkshead. A rock "wet with springs" existed
      there, till it was quarried for road-metal a few years since. But it is
      quite possible that the cottage referred to is Dove Cottage, Grasmere. In
      that case the "rock" and "copse-clad bank" may have been on Loughrigg, or
      more probably on Silver How. The "summer sun" goes down behind Silver How,
      so that it might smite a wet rock either on Hammar Scar or on the wooded
      crags above Red Bank. These could be seen from the window of one of the
      rooms of Dove Cottage. Seated beside the hearth of the "half-kitchen and
      half-parlour fire" in that cottage, and looking along the passage through
      the low door, the eye would rest on Hammar Scar, the wooded hill behind
      Allan Bank. The context of the poem points to Hawkshead; but the details
      of the description suggest the Grasmere cottage rather than Anne Tyson's.&mdash;Ed.</span><br />

      recast, in the blank verse of <i>The Prelude</i>, of the youthful lines
      entitled <i>Extract from the Conclusion of a Poem, composed in
      Anticipation of leaving School</i>. These were composed in Wordsworth's
      sixteenth year. As the contrast is striking, the earlier lines may be
      transcribed:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        'Dear native regions, I foretell,<br /> From what I feel at this
        farewell,<br /> That, wheresoe'er my steps may tend,<br /> And whensoe'er
        my course shall end,<br /> If in that hour a single tie<br /> Survive of
        local sympathy,<br /> My soul will cast the backward view,<br /> The
        longing look alone on you.<br /> <br /> Thus, while the Sun sinks down to
        rest<br /> Far in the regions of the west,<br /> Though to the vale no
        parting beam<br /> Be given, not one memorial gleam,<br /> A lingering
        light he fondly throws<br /> On the dear hills where first he rose.'

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "The beautiful image with which this poem concludes suggested itself to
        me while I was resting in a boat along with my companions under the
        shade of a magnificent row of sycamores, which then extended their
        branches from the shore of the promontory upon with stands the ancient,
        and at that time the more picturesque, Hall of Coniston."

    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">There is nothing in either poem definitely
      to connect "Thurstonmere" with Coniston, although their identity is
      suggested by the Fenwick note. I find, however, that Thurston was the
      ancient name of Coniston; and this carries us back to the time of the
      worship of Thor. (See Lewis's <i>Topographical Dictionary of England</i>,
      vol. i. p. 662; also the <i>Edinburgh Gazetteer</i> (1822), articles
      "Thurston" and "Coniston.") The site of the grove "on the shore of the
      promontory" at Coniston Lake is easily identified, but the grove itself is
      gone.&mdash;Ed.</span><br /> <a href="#fr24b8m0">return</a><br /> <br />

          remembrances, and swayed<br /> In part by fear to shape a way direct,<br />
          That would engulph him soon in the ravenous sea&mdash;<br /> Turns, and
          will measure back his course, far back,<br /> Seeking the very regions
          which he crossed<br /> In his first outset; so have we, my Friend!<br />
          Turned and returned with intricate delay.<br /> Or as a traveller, who
          has gained the brow<br /> Of some aerial Down, while there he halts<br />
          For breathing-time, is tempted to review<br /> The region left behind
          him; and, if aught<br /> Deserving notice have escaped regard,<br /> Or
          been regarded with too careless eye,<br /> Strives, from that height,
          with one and yet one more<br /> Last look, to make the best amends he
          may:<br /> So have we lingered. Now we start afresh<br /> With courage,
          and new hope risen on our toil<br /> Fair greetings to this shapeless
          eagerness,<br /> Whene'er it comes! needful in work so long,<br />
          Thrice needful to the argument which now<br /> Awaits us! Oh, how much
          unlike the past!<br /> <br /> Free as a colt at pasture on the hill,<br />
          I ranged at large, through London's wide domain,<br /> Month after
          month. Obscurely did I live,<br /> Not seeking frequent intercourse
          with men,<br /> By literature, or elegance, or rank,<br />
          Distinguished. Scarcely was a year thus spent<br /> Ere I forsook the
          crowded solitude,<br /> With less regret for its luxurious pomp,<br />
          And all the nicely-guarded shows of art,<br /> Than for the humble
          book-stalls in the streets,<br /> Exposed to eye and hand where'er I
          turned.<br /> <br /> France lured me forth; the realm that I had crossed<br />
          So lately, journeying toward the snow-clad Alps.<br /> But now,
          relinquishing the scrip and staff,<br /> And all enjoyment which the
          summer sun<br /> Sheds round the steps of those who meet the day<br />
          With motion constant as his own, I went<br /> Prepared to sojourn in a
          pleasant town,<br /> Washed by the current of the stately Loire.<br />
          <br /> Through Paris lay my readiest course, and there<br /> Sojourning
          a few days, I visited,<br /> In haste, each spot of old or recent fame,<br />
          The latter chiefly; from the field of Mars<br /> Down to the suburbs of
          St. Antony,<br /> And from Mont Martyr southward to the Dome<br /> Of
          Genevi&egrave;ve. In both her clamorous Halls,<br /> The National Synod
          and the Jacobins,<br /> I saw the Revolutionary Power<br /> Toss like a
          ship at anchor, rocked by storms;<br /> The Arcades I traversed, in the
          Palace huge<br /> Of Orl&eacute;ans; coasted round and round the line<br />
          Of Tavern, Brothel, Gaming-house, and Shop,<br /> Great rendezvous of
          worst and best, the walk<br /> Of all who had a purpose, or had not;<br />
          I stared and listened, with a stranger's ears,<br /> To Hawkers and
          Haranguers, hubbub wild!<br /> And hissing Factionists with ardent
          eyes,<br /> In knots, or pairs, or single. Not a look<br /> Hope takes,
          or Doubt or Fear is forced to wear,<br /> But seemed there present; and
          I scanned them all,<br /> Watched every gesture uncontrollable,<br /> Of
          anger, and vexation, and despite,<br /> All side by side, and
          struggling face to face,<br /> With gaiety and dissolute idleness.<br />
          <br /> Where silent zephyrs sported with the dust<br /> Of the Bastille,
          I sate in the open sun,<br /> And from the rubbish gathered up a stone,<br />
          And pocketed the relic, in the guise<br /> Of an enthusiast; yet, in
          honest truth,<br /> I looked for something that I could not find,<br />
          Affecting more emotion than I felt;<br /> For 'tis most certain, that
          these various sights,<br /> However potent their first shock, with me<br />
          Appeared to recompense the traveller's pains<br /> Less than the
          painted Magdalene of Le Brun,<br /> A beauty exquisitely wrought, with
          hair<br /> Dishevelled, gleaming eyes, and rueful cheek<br /> Pale and
          bedropped with everflowing tears.<br /> <br /> But hence to my more
          permanent abode<br /> I hasten; there, by novelties in speech,<br />
          Domestic manners, customs, gestures, looks,<br /> And all the attire of
          ordinary life,<br /> Attention was engrossed; and, thus amused,<br /> I
          stood, 'mid those concussions, unconcerned,<br /> Tranquil almost, and
          careless as a flower<br /> Glassed in a green-house, or a parlour shrub<br />
          That spreads its leaves in unmolested peace,<br /> While every bush and
          tree, the country through,<br /> Is shaking to the roots: indifference
          this<br /> Which may seem strange: but I was unprepared<br /> With
          needful knowledge, had abruptly passed<br /> Into a theatre, whose
          stage was filled<br /> And busy with an action far advanced.<br /> Like
          others, I had skimmed, and sometimes read<br /> With care, the master
          pamphlets of the day;<br /> Nor wanted such half-insight as grew wild<br />
          Upon that meagre soil, helped out by talk<br /> And public news; but
          having never seen<br /> A chronicle that might suffice to show<br />
          Whence the main organs of the public power<br /> Had sprung, their
          transmigrations, when and how<br /> Accomplished, giving thus unto
          events<br /> A form and body; all things were to me<br /> Loose and
          disjointed, and the affections left<br /> Without a vital interest. At
          that time,<br /> Moreover, the first storm was overblown,<br /> And the
          strong hand of outward violence<br /> Locked up in quiet. For myself, I
          fear<br /> Now in connection with so great a theme<br /> To speak (as I
          must be compelled to do)<br /> Of one so unimportant; night by night<br />
          Did I frequent the formal haunts of men,<br /> Whom, in the city,
          privilege of birth<br /> Sequestered from the rest, societies<br />
          Polished in arts, and in punctilio versed;<br /> Whence, and from
          deeper causes, all discourse<br /> Of good and evil of the time was
          shunned<br /> With scrupulous care; but these restrictions soon<br />
          Proved tedious, and I gradually withdrew<br /> Into a noisier world,
          and thus ere long<br /> Became a patriot; and my heart was all<br />
          Given to the people, and my love was theirs.<br /> <br /> A band of
          military Officers,<br /> Then stationed in the city, were the chief<br />
          Of my associates: some of these wore swords<br /> That had been
          seasoned in the wars, and all<br /> Were men well-born; the chivalry of
          France.<br /> In age and temper differing, they had yet<br /> One spirit
          ruling in each heart; alike<br /> (Save only one, hereafter to be
          named)<br /> Were bent upon undoing what was done:<br /> This was their
          rest and only hope; therewith<br /> No fear had they of bad becoming
          worse,<br /> For worst to them was come; nor would have stirred,<br />
          Or deemed it worth a moment's thought to stir,<br /> In any thing, save
          only as the act<br /> Looked thitherward. One, reckoning by years,<br />
          Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile<br /> He had sate lord in
          many tender hearts;<br /> Though heedless of such honours now, and
          changed:<br /> His temper was quite mastered by the times,<br /> And
          they had blighted him, had eaten away<br /> The beauty of his person,
          doing wrong<br /> Alike to body and to mind: his port,<br /> Which once
          had been erect and open, now<br /> Was stooping and contracted, and a
          face,<br /> Endowed by Nature with her fairest gifts<br /> Of symmetry
          and light and bloom, expressed,<br /> As much as any that was ever
          seen,<br /> A ravage out of season, made by thoughts<br /> Unhealthy and
          vexatious. With the hour,<br /> That from the press of Paris duly
          brought<br /> Its freight of public news, the fever came,<br /> A
          punctual visitant, to shake this man,<br /> Disarmed his voice and
          fanned his yellow cheek<br /> Into a thousand colours; while he read,<br />
          Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touch<br /> Continually, like an
          uneasy place<br /> In his own body. 'Twas in truth an hour<br /> Of
          universal ferment; mildest men<br /> Were agitated; and commotions,
          strife<br /> Of passion and opinion, filled the walls<br /> Of peaceful
          houses with unquiet sounds.<br /> The soil of common life, was, at that
          time,<br /> Too hot to tread upon. Oft said I then,<br /> And not then
          only, "What a mockery this<br /> Of history, the past and that to come!<br />
          Now do I feel how all men are deceived,<br /> Reading of nations and
          their works, in faith,<br /> Faith given to vanity and emptiness;<br />
          Oh! laughter for the page that would reflect<br /> To future times the
          face of what now is!"<br /> The land all swarmed with passion, like a
          plain<br /> Devoured by locusts,&mdash;Carra, Gorsas,&mdash;add<br /> A
          hundred other names, forgotten now,<br /> Nor to be heard of more; yet,
          they were powers,<br /> Like earthquakes, shocks repeated day by day,<br />
          And felt through every nook of town and field.<br /> <br /> Such was the
          state of things. Meanwhile the chief<br /> Of my associates stood
          prepared for flight<br /> To augment the band of emigrants in arms<br />
          Upon the borders of the Rhine, and leagued<br /> With foreign foes
          mustered for instant war.<br /> This was their undisguised intent, and
          they<br /> Were waiting with the whole of their desires<br /> The moment
          to depart.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An Englishman,<br /> Born in a land whose very name
          appeared<br /> To license some unruliness of mind;<br /> A stranger,
          with youth's further privilege,<br /> And the indulgence that a
          half-learnt speech<br /> Wins from the courteous; I, who had been else<br />
          Shunned and not tolerated, freely lived<br /> With these defenders of
          the Crown, and talked,<br /> And heard their notions; nor did they
          disdain<br /> The wish to bring me over to their cause.<br /> <br /> But
          though untaught by thinking or by books<br /> To reason well of polity
          or law,<br /> And nice distinctions, then on every tongue,<br /> Of
          natural rights and civil; and to acts<br /> Of nations and their
          passing interests,<br /> (If with unworldly ends and aims compared)<br />
          Almost indifferent, even the historian's tale<br /> Prizing but little
          otherwise than I prized<br /> Tales of the poets, as it made the heart<br />
          Beat high, and filled the fancy with fair forms,<br /> Old heroes and
          their sufferings and their deeds;<br /> Yet in the regal sceptre, and
          the pomp<br /> Of orders and degrees, I nothing found<br /> Then, or had
          ever, even in crudest youth,<br /> That dazzled me, but rather what I
          mourned<br /> And ill could brook, beholding that the best<br /> Ruled
          not, and feeling that they ought to rule.<br /> <br /> For, born in a
          poor district, and which yet<br /> Retaineth more of ancient
          homeliness,<br /> Than any other nook of English ground,<br /> It was my
          fortune scarcely to have seen,<br /> Through the whole tenor of my
          school-day time,<br /> The face of one, who, whether boy or man,<br />
          Was vested with attention or respect<br /> Through claims of wealth or
          blood; nor was it least<br /> Of many benefits, in later years<br />
          Derived from academic institutes<br /> And rules, that they held
          something up to view<br /> Of a Republic, where all stood thus far<br />
          Upon equal ground; that we were brothers all<br /> In honour, as in one
          community,<br /> Scholars and gentlemen; where, furthermore,<br />
          Distinction open lay to all that came,<br /> And wealth and titles were
          in less esteem<br /> Than talents, worth, and prosperous industry.<br />
          Add unto this, subservience from the first<br /> To presences of God's
          mysterious power<br /> Made manifest in Nature's sovereignty,<br /> And
          fellowship with venerable books,<br /> To sanction the proud workings
          of the soul,<br /> And mountain liberty. It could not be<br /> But that
          one tutored thus should look with awe<br /> Upon the faculties of man,
          receive<br /> Gladly the highest promises, and hail,<br /> As best, the
          government of equal rights<br /> And individual worth. And hence, O
          Friend!<br /> If at the first great outbreak I rejoiced<br /> Less than
          might well befit my youth, the cause<br /> In part lay here, that unto
          me the events<br /> Seemed nothing out of nature's certain course,<br />
          A gift that was come rather late than soon.<br /> No wonder, then, if
          advocates like these,<br /> Inflamed by passion, blind with prejudice,<br />
          And stung with injury, at this riper day,<br /> Were impotent to make
          my hopes put on<br /> The shape of theirs, my understanding bend<br />
          In honour to their honour: zeal, which yet<br /> Had slumbered, now in
          opposition burst<br /> Forth like a Polar summer: every word<br /> They
          uttered was a dart, by counter-winds<br /> Blown back upon themselves;
          their reason seemed<br /> Confusion-stricken by a higher power<br />
          Than human understanding, their discourse<br /> Maimed, spiritless;
          and, in their weakness strong,<br /> I triumphed.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meantime, day
          by day, the roads<br /> Were crowded with the bravest youth of France,<br />
          And all the promptest of her spirits, linked<br /> In gallant
          soldiership, and posting on<br /> To meet the war upon her frontier
          bounds.<br /> Yet at this very moment do tears start<br /> Into mine
          eyes: I do not say I weep&mdash;<br /> I wept not then,&mdash;but tears
          have dimmed my sight,<br /> In memory of the farewells of that time,<br />
          Domestic severings, female fortitude<br /> At dearest separation,
          patriot love<br /> And self-devotion, and terrestrial hope,<br />
          Encouraged with a martyr's confidence;<br /> Even files of strangers
          merely seen but once,<br /> And for a moment, men from far with sound<br />
          Of music, martial tunes, and banners spread,<br /> Entering the city,
          here and there a face,<br /> Or person singled out among the rest,<br />
          Yet still a stranger and beloved as such;<br /> Even by these passing
          spectacles my heart<br /> Was oftentimes uplifted, and they seemed<br />
          Arguments sent from Heaven to prove the cause<br /> Good, pure, which
          no one could stand up against,<br /> Who was not lost, abandoned,
          selfish, proud,<br /> Mean, miserable, wilfully depraved,<br /> Hater
          perverse of equity and truth.<br /> <br /> Among that band of Officers
          was one,<br /> Already hinted at, of other mould&mdash;<br /> A patriot,
          thence rejected by the rest,<br /> And with an oriental loathing
          spurned,<br /> As of a different caste. A meeker man<br /> Than this
          lived never, nor a more benign,<br /> Meek though enthusiastic.
          Injuries<br /> Made <i>him</i> more gracious, and his nature then<br />
          Did breathe its sweetness out most sensibly,<br /> As aromatic flowers
          on Alpine turf,<br /> When foot hath crushed them. He through the
          events<br /> Of that great change wandered in perfect faith,<br /> As
          through a book, an old romance, or tale<br /> Of Fairy, or some dream
          of actions wrought<br /> Behind the summer clouds. By birth he ranked<br />
          With the most noble, but unto the poor<br /> Among mankind he was in
          service bound,<br /> As by some tie invisible, oaths professed<br /> To
          a religious order. Man he loved<br /> As man; and, to the mean and the
          obscure,<br /> And all the homely in their homely works,<br />
          Transferred a courtesy which had no air<br /> Of condescension; but did
          rather seem<br /> A passion and a gallantry, like that<br /> Which he, a
          soldier, in his idler day<br /> Had paid to woman: somewhat vain he
          was,<br /> Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity,<br /> But fondness, and
          a kind of radiant joy<br /> Diffused around him, while he was intent<br />
          On works of love or freedom, or revolved<br /> Complacently the
          progress of a cause,<br /> Whereof he was a part: yet this was meek<br />
          And placid, and took nothing from the man<br /> That was delightful.
          Oft in solitude<br /> With him did I discourse about the end<br /> Of
          civil government, and its wisest forms;<br /> Of ancient loyalty, and
          chartered rights,<br /> Custom and habit, novelty and change;<br /> Of
          self-respect, and virtue in the few<br /> For patrimonial honour set
          apart,<br /> And ignorance in the labouring multitude.<br /> For he, to
          all intolerance indisposed,<br /> Balanced these contemplations in his
          mind;<br /> And I, who at that time was scarcely dipped<br /> Into the
          turmoil, bore a sounder judgment<br /> Than later days allowed; carried
          about me,<br /> With less alloy to its integrity,<br /> The experience
          of past ages, as, through help<br /> Of books and common life, it makes
          sure way<br /> To youthful minds, by objects over near<br /> Not pressed
          upon, nor dazzled or misled<br /> By struggling with the crowd for
          present ends.<br /> <br /> But though not deaf, nor obstinate to find<br />
          Error without excuse upon the side<br /> Of them who strove against us,
          more delight<br /> We took, and let this freely be confessed,<br /> In
          painting to ourselves the miseries<br /> Of royal courts, and that
          voluptuous life<br /> Unfeeling, where the man who is of soul<br /> The
          meanest thrives the most; where dignity,<br /> True personal dignity,
          abideth not;<br /> A light, a cruel, and vain world cut off<br /> From
          the natural inlets of just sentiment,<br /> From lowly sympathy and
          chastening truth;<br /> Where good and evil interchange their names,<br />
          And thirst for bloody spoils abroad is paired<br /> With vice at home.
          We added dearest themes&mdash;<br /> Man and his noble nature, as it is<br />
          The gift which God has placed within his power,<br /> His blind desires
          and steady faculties<br /> Capable of clear truth, the one to break<br />
          Bondage, the other to build liberty<br /> On firm foundations, making
          social life,<br /> Through knowledge spreading and imperishable,<br />
          As just in regulation, and as pure<br /> As individual in the wise and
          good.<br /> <br /> We summoned up the honourable deeds<br /> Of ancient
          Story, thought of each bright spot,<br /> That would be found in all
          recorded time,<br /> Of truth preserved and error passed away;<br /> Of
          single spirits that catch the flame from Heaven,<br /> And how the
          multitudes of men will feed<br /> And fan each other; thought of sects,
          how keen<br /> They are to put the appropriate nature on,<br />
          Triumphant over every obstacle<br /> Of custom, language, country,
          love, or hate,<br /> And what they do and suffer for their creed;<br />
          How far they travel, and how long endure;<br /> How quickly mighty
          Nations have been formed,<br /> From least beginnings; how, together
          locked<br /> By new opinions, scattered tribes have made<br /> One body,
          spreading wide as clouds in heaven.<br /> To aspirations then of our
          own minds<br /> Did we appeal; and, finally, beheld<br /> A living
          confirmation of the whole<br /> Before us, in a people from the depth<br />
          Of shameful imbecility uprisen,<br /> Fresh as the morning star. Elate
          we looked<br /> Upon their virtues; saw, in rudest men,<br />
          Self-sacrifice the firmest; generous love,<br /> And continence of
          mind, and sense of right,<br /> Uppermost in the midst of fiercest
          strife.<br /> <br /> Oh, sweet it is, in academic groves,<br /> Or such
          retirement, Friend! as we have known<br /> In the green dales beside
          our Rotha's stream,<br /> Greta, or Derwent, or some nameless rill,<br />
          To ruminate, with interchange of talk,<br /> On rational liberty, and
          hope in man,<br /> Justice and peace. But far more sweet such toil&mdash;<br />
          Toil, say I, for it leads to thoughts abstruse&mdash;<br /> If nature
          then be standing on the brink<br /> Of some great trial, and we hear
          the voice<br /> Of one devoted, one whom circumstance<br /> Hath called
          upon to embody his deep sense<br /> In action, give it outwardly a
          shape,<br /> And that of benediction, to the world.<br /> Then doubt is
          not, and truth is more than truth,&mdash;<br /> A hope it is, and a
          desire; a creed<br /> Of zeal, by an authority Divine<br /> Sanctioned,
          of danger, difficulty, or death.<br /> Such conversation, under Attic
          shades,<br /> Did Dion hold with Plato; ripened thus<br /> For a
          Deliverer's glorious task,&mdash;and such<br /> He, on that ministry
          already bound,<br /> Held with Eudemus and Timonides,<br /> Surrounded
          by adventurers in arms,<br /> When those two vessels with their daring
          freight,<br /> For the Sicilian Tyrant's overthrow,<br /> Sailed from
          Zacynthus,&mdash;philosophic war,<br /> Led by Philosophers. With
          harder fate,<br /> Though like ambition, such was he, O Friend!<br /> Of
          whom I speak. So Beaupuis (let the name<br /> Stand near the worthiest
          of Antiquity)<br /> Fashioned his life; and many a long discourse,<br />
          With like persuasion honoured, we maintained:<br /> He, on his part,
          accoutred for the worst.<br /> He perished fighting, in supreme
          command,<br /> Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire,<br /> For liberty,
          against deluded men,<br /> His fellow country-men; and yet most blessed<br />
          In this, that he the fate of later times<br /> Lived not to see, nor
          what we now behold,<br /> Who have as ardent hearts as he had then.<br />
          <br /> Along that very Loire, with festal mirth<br /> Resounding at all
          hours, and innocent yet<br /> Of civil slaughter, was our frequent
          walk;<br /> Or in wide forests of continuous shade,<br /> Lofty and
          over-arched, with open space<br /> Beneath the trees, clear footing
          many a mile&mdash;<br /> A solemn region. Oft amid those haunts,<br />
          From earnest dialogues I slipped in thought,<br /> And let remembrance
          steal to other times,<br /> When, o'er those interwoven roots,
          moss-clad,<br /> And smooth as marble or a waveless sea,<br /> Some
          Hermit, from his cell forth-strayed, might pace<br /> In sylvan
          meditation undisturbed;<br /> As on the pavement of a Gothic church<br />
          Walks a lone Monk, when service hath expired,<br /> In peace and
          silence. But if e'er was heard,&mdash;<br /> Heard, though unseen,&mdash;a
          devious traveller,<br /> Retiring or approaching from afar<br /> With
          speed and echoes loud of trampling hoofs<br /> From the hard floor
          reverberated, then<br /> It was Angelica thundering through the woods<br />
          Upon her palfrey, or that gentle maid<br /> Erminia, fugitive as fair
          as she.<br /> Sometimes methought I saw a pair of knights<br /> Joust
          underneath the trees, that as in storm<br /> Rocked high above their
          heads; anon, the din<br /> Of boisterous merriment, and music's roar,<br />
          In sudden proclamation, burst from haunt<br /> Of Satyrs in some
          viewless glade, with dance<br /> Rejoicing o'er a female in the midst,<br />
          A mortal beauty, their unhappy thrall.<br /> The width of those huge
          forests, unto me<br /> A novel scene, did often in this way<br /> Master
          my fancy while I wandered on<br /> With that revered companion. And
          sometimes&mdash;<br /> When to a convent in a meadow green,<br /> By a
          brook-side, we came, a roofless pile,<br /> And not by reverential
          touch of Time<br /> Dismantled, but by violence abrupt&mdash;<br /> In
          spite of those heart-bracing colloquies,<br /> In spite of real
          fervour, and of that<br /> Less genuine and wrought up within myself&mdash;<br />
          I could not but bewail a wrong so harsh,<br /> And for the Matin-bell
          to sound no more<br /> Grieved, and the twilight taper, and the cross<br />
          High on the topmost pinnacle, a sign<br /> (How welcome to the weary
          traveller's eyes!)<br /> Of hospitality and peaceful rest.<br /> And
          when the partner of those varied walks<br /> Pointed upon occasion to
          the site<br /> Of Romorentin, home of ancient kings,<br /> To the
          imperial edifice of Blois,<br /> Or to that rural castle, name now
          slipped<br /> From my remembrance, where a lady lodged,<br /> By the
          first Francis wooed, and bound to him<br /> In chains of mutual
          passion, from the tower,<br /> As a tradition of the country tells,<br />
          Practised to commune with her royal knight<br /> By cressets and
          love-beacons, intercourse<br /> 'Twixt her high-seated residence and
          his<br /> Far off at Chambord on the plain beneath;<br /> Even here,
          though less than with the peaceful house<br /> Religious, 'mid those
          frequent monuments<br /> Of Kings, their vices and their better deeds,<br />
          Imagination, potent to inflame<br /> At times with virtuous wrath and
          noble scorn,<br /> Did also often mitigate the force<br /> Of civic
          prejudice, the bigotry,<br /> So call it, of a youthful patriot's mind;<br />
          And on these spots with many gleams I looked<br /> Of chivalrous
          delight. Yet not the less,<br /> Hatred of absolute rule, where will of
          one<br /> Is law for all, and of that barren pride<br /> In them who, by
          immunities unjust,<br /> Between the sovereign and the people stand,<br />
          His helper and not theirs, laid stronger hold<br /> Daily upon me,
          mixed with pity too<br /> And love; for where hope is, there love will
          be<br /> For the abject multitude. And when we chanced<br /> One day to
          meet a hunger-bitten girl,<br /> Who crept along fitting her languid
          gait<br /> Unto a heifer's motion, by a cord<br /> Tied to her arm, and
          picking thus from the lane<br /> Its sustenance, while the girl with
          pallid hands<br /> Was busy knitting in a heartless mood<br /> Of
          solitude, and at the sight my friend<br /> In agitation said, "'Tis
          against 'that'<br /> That we are fighting," I with him believed<br />
          That a benignant spirit was abroad<br /> Which might not be withstood,
          that poverty<br /> Abject as this would in a little time<br /> Be found
          no more, that we should see the earth<br /> Unthwarted in her wish to
          recompense<br /> The meek, the lowly, patient child of toil,<br /> All
          institutes for ever blotted out<br /> That legalised exclusion, empty
          pomp<br /> Abolished, sensual state and cruel power,<br /> Whether by
          edict of the one or few;<br /> And finally, as sum and crown of all,<br />
          Should see the people having a strong hand<br /> In framing their own
          laws; whence better days<br /> To all mankind. But, these things set
          apart,<br /> Was not this single confidence enough<br /> To animate the
          mind that ever turned<br /> A thought to human welfare? That henceforth<br />
          Captivity by mandate without law<br /> Should cease; and open
          accusation lead<br /> To sentence in the hearing of the world,<br /> And
          open punishment, if not the air<br /> Be free to breathe in, and the
          heart of man<br /> Dread nothing. From this height I shall not stoop<br />
          To humbler matter that detained us oft<br /> In thought or
          conversation, public acts,<br /> And public persons, and emotions
          wrought<br /> Within the breast, as ever-varying winds<br /> Of record
          or report swept over us;<br /> But I might here, instead, repeat a
          tale,<br /> Told by my Patriot friend, of sad events,<br /> That prove
          to what low depth had struck the roots,<br /> How widely spread the
          boughs, of that old tree<br /> Which, as a deadly mischief, and a foul<br />
          And black dishonour, France was weary of.<br /> <br /> Oh, happy time of
          youthful lovers, (thus<br /> The story might begin). Oh, balmy time,<br />
          In which a love-knot, on a lady's brow,<br /> Is fairer than the
          fairest star in Heaven!<br /> So might&mdash;and with that prelude <i>did</i>
          begin<br /> The record; and, in faithful verse, was given<br /> The
          doleful sequel.<br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But our little bark<br /> On a
          strong river boldly hath been launched;<br /> And from the driving
          current should we turn<br /> To loiter wilfully within a creek,<br />
          Howe'er attractive, Fellow voyager!<br /> Would'st thou not chide? Yet
          deem not my pains lost:<br /> For Vaudracour and Julia (so were named<br />
          The ill-fated pair) in that plain tale will draw<br /> Tears from the
          hearts of others, when their own<br /> Shall beat no more. Thou, also,
          there may'st read,<br /> At leisure, how the enamoured youth was
          driven,<br /> By public power abased, to fatal crime,<br /> Nature's
          rebellion against monstrous law;<br /> How, between heart and heart,
          oppression thrust<br /> Her mandates, severing whom true love had
          joined,<br /> Harassing both; until he sank and pressed<br /> The couch
          his fate had made for him; supine,<br /> Save when the stings of
          viperous remorse,<br /> Trying their strength, enforced him to start
          up,<br /> Aghast and prayerless. Into a deep wood<br /> He fled, to shun
          the haunts of human kind;<br /> There dwelt, weakened in spirit more
          and more;<br /> Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through France<br />
          Full speedily resounded, public hope,<br /> Or personal memory of his
          own worst wrongs,<br /> Rouse him; but, hidden in those gloomy shades,<br />
          His days he wasted,&mdash;an imbecile mind.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a

      &nbsp;<span style="color: #555555;">When Plato visited Syracuse, in the
      reign of Dionysius, Dion became his disciple, and induced Dionysius to
      invite Plato a second time to Syracuse. But neither Plato nor Dion could
      succeed in their efforts to influence and elevate Dionysius. Dion withdrew
      to Athens, and lived in close intimacy with Plato, and with Speusippus.
      The latter urged him to return, and deliver Sicily from the tyrant
      Dionysius, who had become unpopular in the island. Dion got some of the
      Syracusan exiles in Greece to join him, and "sailed from Zacynthus," with
      two merchant ships, and about 800 troops. He took Syracuse, and became
      dictator of the district. But&mdash;as was the case with the tyrants of
      the French Revolution who took the place of those of the old regime
      (record later on in <i>The Prelude</i>)&mdash;the Syracusans found that
      they had only exchanged one form of rigour for another. It is thus that
      Plutarch refers to the occurrence. </span>

          It was a beautiful and silent day<br /> That overspread the countenance
          of earth,<br /> Then fading with unusual quietness,&mdash;<br /> A day
          as beautiful as e'er was given<br /> To soothe regret, though deepening
          what it soothed,<br /> When by the gliding Loire I paused, and cast<br />
          Upon his rich domains, vineyard and tilth,<br /> Green meadow-ground,
          and many-coloured woods,<br /> Again, and yet again, a farewell look;<br />
          Then from the quiet of that scene passed on,<br /> Bound to the fierce
          Metropolis. From his throne<br /> The King had fallen, and that
          invading host&mdash;<br /> Presumptuous cloud, on whose black front was
          written<br /> The tender mercies of the dismal wind<br /> That bore it&mdash;on
          the plains of Liberty<br /> Had burst innocuous. Say in bolder words,<br />
          They&mdash;who had come elate as eastern hunters<br /> Banded beneath
          the Great Mogul, when he<br /> Erewhile went forth from Agra or Lahore,<br />
          Rajahs and Omrahs in his train, intent<br /> To drive their prey
          enclosed within a ring<br /> Wide as a province, but, the signal given,<br />
          Before the point of the life-threatening spear<br /> Narrowing itself
          by moments&mdash;they, rash men,<br /> Had seen the anticipated quarry
          turned<br /> Into avengers, from whose wrath they fled<br /> In terror.
          Disappointment and dismay<br /> Remained for all whose fancies had run
          wild<br /> With evil expectations; confidence<br /> And perfect triumph
          for the better cause.<br /> <br /> The State, as if to stamp the final
          seal<br /> On her security, and to the world<br /> Show what she was, a
          high and fearless soul,<br /> Exulting in defiance, or heart-stung<br />
          By sharp resentment, or belike to taunt<br /> With spiteful gratitude
          the baffled League,<br /> That had stirred up her slackening faculties<br />
          To a new transition, when the King was crushed,<br /> Spared not the
          empty throne, and in proud haste<br /> Assumed the body and venerable
          name<br /> Of a Republic. Lamentable crimes,<br /> 'Tis true, had gone
          before this hour, dire work<br /> Of massacre, in which the senseless
          sword<br /> Was prayed to as a judge; but these were past,<br /> Earth
          free from them for ever, as was thought,&mdash;<br /> Ephemeral
          monsters, to be seen but once!<br /> Things that could only show
          themselves and die.<br /> <br /> Cheered with this hope, to Paris I
          returned,<br /> And ranged, with ardour heretofore unfelt,<br /> The
          spacious city, and in progress passed<br /> The prison where the
          unhappy Monarch lay,<br /> Associate with his children and his wife<br />
          In bondage; and the palace, lately stormed<br /> With roar of cannon by
          a furious host.<br /> I crossed the square (an empty area then!)<br />
          Of the Carrousel, where so late had lain<br /> The dead, upon the dying
          heaped, and gazed<br /> On this and other spots, as doth a man<br />
          Upon a volume whose contents he knows<br /> Are memorable, but from him
          locked up,<br /> Being written in a tongue he cannot read,<br /> So that
          he questions the mute leaves with pain,<br /> And half upbraids their
          silence. But that night<br /> I felt most deeply in what world I was,<br />
          What ground I trod on, and what air I breathed.<br /> High was my room
          and lonely, near the roof<br /> Of a large mansion or hotel, a lodge<br />
          That would have pleased me in more quiet times;<br /> Nor was it wholly
          without pleasure then.<br /> With unextinguished taper I kept watch,<br />
          Reading at intervals; the fear gone by<br /> Pressed on me almost like
          a fear to come.<br /> I thought of those September massacres,<br />
          Divided from me by one little month, <br /> Saw them and touched: the
          rest was conjured up<br /> From tragic fictions or true history,<br />
          Remembrances and dim admonishments.<br /> The horse is taught his
          manage, and no star<br /> Of wildest course but treads back his own
          steps;<br /> For the spent hurricane the air provides<br /> As fierce a
          successor; the tide retreats<br /> But to return out of its
          hiding-place<br /> In the great deep; all things have second-birth;<br />
          The earthquake is not satisfied at once;<br /> And in this way I
          wrought upon myself,<br /> Until I seemed to hear a voice that cried,<br />
          To the whole city, "Sleep no more." The trance<br /> Fled with the
          voice to which it had given birth;<br /> But vainly comments of a
          calmer mind<br /> Promised soft peace and sweet forgetfulness.<br /> The
          place, all hushed and silent as it was,<br /> Appeared unfit for the
          repose of night,<br /> Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam.<br />
          <br /> With early morning towards the Palace-walk<br /> Of Orl&eacute;ans
          eagerly I turned; as yet<br /> The streets were still; not so those
          long Arcades;<br /> There, 'mid a peal of ill-matched sounds and cries,<br />
          That greeted me on entering, I could hear<br /> Shrill voices from the
          hawkers in the throng,<br /> Bawling, "Denunciation of the Crimes<br />
          Of Maximilian Robespierre;" the hand,<br /> Prompt as the voice, held
          forth a printed speech,<br /> The same that had been recently
          pronounced,<br /> When Robespierre, not ignorant for what mark<br />
          Some words of indirect reproof had been<br /> Intended, rose in
          hardihood, and dared<br /> The man who had an ill surmise of him<br />
          To bring his charge in openness; whereat,<br /> When a dead pause
          ensued, and no one stirred,<br /> In silence of all present, from his
          seat<br /> Louvet walked single through the avenue,<br /> And took his
          station in the Tribune, saying,<br /> "I, Robespierre, accuse thee!"
          Well is known<br /> The inglorious issue of that charge, and how<br />
          He, who had launched the startling thunderbolt,<br /> The one bold man,
          whose voice the attack had sounded,<br /> Was left without a follower
          to discharge<br /> His perilous duty, and retire lamenting<br /> That
          Heaven's best aid is wasted upon men<br /> Who to themselves are false.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          But these are things<br /> Of which I speak, only as they were storm<br />
          Or sunshine to my individual mind,<br /> No further. Let me then relate
          that now&mdash;<br /> In some sort seeing with my proper eyes<br /> That
          Liberty, and Life, and Death would soon<br /> To the remotest corners
          of the land<br /> Lie in the arbitrement of those who ruled<br /> The
          capital City; what was struggled for,<br /> And by what combatants
          victory must be won;<br /> The indecision on their part whose aim<br />
          Seemed best, and the straightforward path of those<br /> Who in attack
          or in defence were strong<br /> Through their impiety&mdash;my inmost
          soul<br /> Was agitated; yea, I could almost<br /> Have prayed that
          throughout earth upon all men,<br /> By patient exercise of reason made<br />
          Worthy of liberty, all spirits filled<br /> With zeal expanding in
          Truth's holy light,<br /> The gift of tongues might fall, and power
          arrive<br /> From the four quarters of the winds to do<br /> For France,
          what without help she could not do,<br /> A work of honour; think not
          that to this<br /> I added, work of safety: from all doubt<br /> Or
          trepidation for the end of things<br /> Far was I, far as angels are
          from guilt.<br /> <br /> Yet did I grieve, nor only grieved, but thought<br />
          Of opposition and of remedies:<br /> An insignificant stranger and
          obscure,<br /> And one, moreover, little graced with power<br /> Of
          eloquence even in my native speech,<br /> And all unfit for tumult or
          intrigue,<br /> Yet would I at this time with willing heart<br /> Have
          undertaken for a cause so great<br /> Service however dangerous. I
          revolved,<br /> How much the destiny of Man had still<br /> Hung upon
          single persons; that there was,<br /> Transcendent to all local
          patrimony,<br /> One nature, as there is one sun in heaven;<br /> That
          objects, even as they are great, thereby<br /> Do come within the reach
          of humblest eyes;<br /> That Man is only weak through his mistrust<br />
          And want of hope where evidence divine<br /> Proclaims to him that hope
          should be most sure;<br /> Nor did the inexperience of my youth<br />
          Preclude conviction, that a spirit strong,<br /> In hope, and trained
          to noble aspirations,<br /> A spirit thoroughly faithful to itself,<br />
          Is for Society's unreasoning herd<br /> A domineering instinct, serves
          at once<br /> For way and guide, a fluent receptacle<br /> That gathers
          up each petty straggling rill<br /> And vein of water, glad to be
          rolled on<br /> In safe obedience; that a mind, whose rest<br /> Is
          where it ought to be, in self-restraint,<br /> In circumspection and
          simplicity,<br /> Falls rarely in entire discomfiture<br /> Below its
          aim, or meets with, from without,<br /> A treachery that foils it or
          defeats;<br /> And, lastly, if the means on human will,<br /> Frail
          human will, dependent should betray<br /> Him who too boldly trusted
          them, I felt<br /> That 'mid the loud distractions of the world<br /> A
          sovereign voice subsists within the soul,<br /> Arbiter undisturbed of
          right and wrong,<br /> Of life and death, in majesty severe<br />
          Enjoining, as may best promote the aims<br /> Of truth and justice,
          either sacrifice,<br /> From whatsoever region of our cares<br /> Or our
          infirm affections Nature pleads,<br /> Earnest and blind, against the
          stern decree.<br /> <br /> On the other side, I called to mind those
          truths<br /> That are the common-places of the schools&mdash;<br /> (A
          theme for boys, too hackneyed for their sires,)<br /> Yet, with a
          revelation's liveliness,<br /> In all their comprehensive bearings
          known<br /> And visible to philosophers of old,<br /> Men who, to
          business of the world untrained,<br /> Lived in the shade; and to
          Harmodius known<br /> And his compeer Aristogiton, known<br /> To Brutus&mdash;that
          tyrannic power is weak,<br /> Hath neither gratitude, nor faith, nor
          love,<br /> Nor the support of good or evil men<br /> To trust in; that
          the godhead which is ours<br /> Can never utterly be charmed or
          stilled;<br /> That nothing hath a natural right to last<br /> But
          equity and reason; that all else<br /> Meets foes irreconcilable, and
          at best<br /> Lives only by variety of disease.<br /> <br /> Well might
          my wishes be intense, my thoughts<br /> Strong and perturbed, not
          doubting at that time<br /> But that the virtue of one paramount mind<br />
          Would have abashed those impious crests&mdash;have quelled<br />
          Outrage and bloody power, and, in despite<br /> Of what the People long
          had been and were<br /> Through ignorance and false teaching, sadder
          proof<br /> Of immaturity, and in the teeth<br /> Of desperate
          opposition from without&mdash;<br /> Have cleared a passage for just
          government,<br /> And left a solid birthright to the State,<br />
          Redeemed, according to example given<br /> By ancient lawgivers.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          In this frame of mind,<br /> Dragged by a chain of harsh necessity,<br />
          So seemed it,&mdash;now I thankfully acknowledge,<br /> Forced by the
          gracious providence of Heaven,&mdash;<br /> To England I returned, else
          (though assured<br /> That I both was and must be of small weight,<br />
          No better than a landsman on the deck<br /> Of a ship struggling with a
          hideous storm)<br /> Doubtless, I should have then made common cause<br />
          With some who perished; haply perished too,<br /> A poor mistaken and
          bewildered offering,&mdash;<br /> Should to the breast of Nature have
          gone back,<br /> With all my resolutions, all my hopes,<br /> A Poet
          only to myself, to men<br /> Useless, and even, beloved Friend! a soul<br />
          To thee unknown!<br /> <br /> Twice had the trees let fall<br /> Their
          leaves, as often Winter had put on<br /> His hoary crown, since I had
          seen the surge<br /> Beat against Albion's shore, since ear of mine<br />
          Had caught the accents of my native speech<br /> Upon our native
          country's sacred ground.<br /> A patriot of the world, how could I
          glide<br /> Into communion with her sylvan shades,<br /> Erewhile my
          tuneful haunt? It pleased me more<br /> To abide in the great City,
          where I found<br /> The general air still busy with the stir<br /> Of
          that first memorable onset made<br /> By a strong levy of humanity<br />
          Upon the traffickers in Negro blood;<br /> Effort which, though
          defeated, had recalled<br /> To notice old forgotten principles,<br />
          And through the nation spread a novel heat<br /> Of virtuous feeling.
          For myself, I own<br /> That this particular strife had wanted power<br />
          To rivet my affections; nor did now<br /> Its unsuccessful issue much
          excite<br /> My sorrow; for I brought with me the faith<br /> That, if
          France prospered, good men would not long<br /> Pay fruitless worship
          to humanity,<br /> And this most rotten branch of human shame,<br />
          Object, so seemed it, of superfluous pains,<br /> Would fall together
          with its parent tree.<br /> What, then, were my emotions, when in arms<br />
          Britain put forth her free-born strength in league,<br /> Oh, pity and
          shame! with those confederate Powers!<br /> Not in my single self alone
          I found,<br /> But in the minds of all ingenuous youth,<br /> Change and
          subversion from that hour. No shock<br /> Given to my moral nature had
          I known<br /> Down to that very moment; neither lapse<br /> Nor turn of
          sentiment that might be named<br /> A revolution, save at this one
          time;<br /> All else was progress on the self-same path<br /> On which,
          with a diversity of pace,<br /> I had been travelling: this a stride at
          once<br /> Into another region. As a light<br /> And pliant harebell,
          swinging in the breeze<br /> On some grey rock&mdash;its birth-place&mdash;so
          had I<br /> Wantoned, fast rooted on the ancient tower<br /> Of my
          beloved country, wishing not<br /> A happier fortune than to wither
          there:<br /> Now was I from that pleasant station torn<br /> And tossed
          about in whirlwind. I rejoiced,<br /> Yea, afterwards&mdash;truth most
          painful to record!&mdash;<br /> Exulted, in the triumph of my soul,<br />
          When Englishmen by thousands were o'erthrown,<br /> Left without glory
          on the field, or driven,<br /> Brave hearts! to shameful flight. It was
          a grief,&mdash;<br /> Grief call it not, 'twas anything but that,&mdash;<br />
          A conflict of sensations without name,<br /> Of which <i>he</i> only,
          who may love the sight<br /> Of a village steeple, as I do, can judge,<br />
          When, in the congregation bending all<br /> To their great Father,
          prayers were offered up,<br /> Or praises for our country's victories;<br />
          And, 'mid the simple worshippers, perchance<br /> I only, like an
          uninvited guest<br /> Whom no one owned, sate silent; shall I add,<br />
          Fed on the day of vengeance yet to come.<br /> <br /> Oh! much have they
          to account for, who could tear,<br /> By violence, at one decisive
          rent,<br /> From the best youth in England their dear pride,<br /> Their
          joy, in England; this, too, at a time<br /> In which worst losses
          easily might wean<br /> The best of names, when patriotic love<br /> Did
          of itself in modesty give way,<br /> Like the Precursor when the Deity<br />
          Is come Whose harbinger he was; a time<br /> In which apostasy from
          ancient faith<br /> Seemed but conversion to a higher creed;<br />
          Withal a season dangerous and wild,<br /> A time when sage Experience
          would have snatched<br /> Flowers out of any hedge-row to compose<br />
          A chaplet in contempt of his grey locks.<br /> <br /> When the proud
          fleet that bears the red-cross flag<br /> In that unworthy service was
          prepared<br /> To mingle, I beheld the vessels lie,<br /> A brood of
          gallant creatures, on the deep;<br /> I saw them in their rest, a
          sojourner<br /> Through a whole month of calm and glassy days<br /> In
          that delightful island which protects<br /> Their place of convocation&mdash;there
          I heard,<br /> Each evening, pacing by the still sea-shore,<br /> A
          monitory sound that never failed,&mdash;<br /> The sunset cannon. While
          the orb went down<br /> In the tranquillity of nature, came<br /> That
          voice, ill requiem! seldom heard by me<br /> Without a spirit overcast
          by dark<br /> Imaginations, sense of woes to come,<br /> Sorrow for
          human kind, and pain of heart.<br /> <br /> In France, the men, who, for
          their desperate ends,<br /> Had plucked up mercy by the roots, were
          glad<br /> Of this new enemy. Tyrants, strong before<br /> In wicked
          pleas, were strong as demons now;<br /> And thus, on every side beset
          with foes,<br /> The goaded land waxed mad; the crimes of few<br />
          Spread into madness of the many; blasts<br /> From hell came sanctified
          like airs from heaven.<br /> The sternness of the just, the faith of
          those<br /> Who doubted not that Providence had times<br /> Of vengeful
          retribution, theirs who throned<br /> The human Understanding paramount<br />
          And made of that their God, the hopes of men<br /> Who were content to
          barter short-lived pangs<br /> For a paradise of ages, the blind rage<br />
          Of insolent tempers, the light vanity<br /> Of intermeddlers, steady
          purposes<br /> Of the suspicious, slips of the indiscreet,<br /> And all
          the accidents of life were pressed<br /> Into one service, busy with
          one work.<br /> The Senate stood aghast, her prudence quenched,<br />
          Her wisdom stifled, and her justice scared,<br /> Her frenzy only
          active to extol<br /> Past outrages, and shape the way for new,<br />
          Which no one dared to oppose or mitigate.<br /> <br /> Domestic carnage
          now filled the whole year<br /> With feast-days; old men from the
          chimney-nook,<br /> The maiden from the bosom of her love,<br /> The
          mother from the cradle of her babe,<br /> The warrior from the field&mdash;all
          perished, all&mdash;<br /> Friends, enemies, of all parties, ages,
          ranks,<br /> Head after head, and never heads enough<br /> For those
          that bade them fall. They found their joy,<br /> They made it proudly,
          eager as a child,<br /> (If like desires of innocent little ones<br />
          May with such heinous appetites be compared,)<br /> Pleased in some
          open field to exercise<br /> A toy that mimics with revolving wings<br />
          The motion of a wind-mill; though the air<br /> Do of itself blow
          fresh, and make the vanes<br /> Spin in his eyesight, <i>that</i>
          contents him not,<br /> But, with the plaything at arm's length, he
          sets<br /> His front against the blast, and runs amain,<br /> That it
          may whirl the faster.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amid the depth<br /> Of those
          enormities, even thinking minds<br /> Forgot, at seasons, whence they
          had their being;<br /> Forgot that such a sound was ever heard<br /> As
          Liberty upon earth: yet all beneath<br /> Her innocent authority was
          wrought,<br /> Nor could have been, without her blessed name.<br /> The
          illustrious wife of Roland, in the hour<br /> Of her composure, felt
          that agony,<br /> And gave it vent in her last words. O Friend!<br /> It
          was a lamentable time for man,<br /> Whether a hope had e'er been his
          or not;<br /> A woful time for them whose hopes survived<br /> The
          shock; most woful for those few who still<br /> Were flattered, and had
          trust in human kind:<br /> They had the deepest feeling of the grief.<br />
          Meanwhile the Invaders fared as they deserved:<br /> The Herculean
          Commonwealth had put forth her arms,<br /> And throttled with an infant
          godhead's might<br /> The snakes about her cradle; that was well,<br />
          And as it should be; yet no cure for them<br /> Whose souls were sick
          with pain of what would be<br /> Hereafter brought in charge against
          mankind.<br /> Most melancholy at that time, O Friend!<br /> Were my
          day-thoughts,&mdash;my nights were miserable;<br /> Through months,
          through years, long after the last beat<br /> Of those atrocities, the
          hour of sleep<br /> To me came rarely charged with natural gifts,<br />
          Such ghastly visions had I of despair<br /> And tyranny, and implements
          of death;<br /> And innocent victims sinking under fear,<br /> And
          momentary hope, and worn-out prayer,<br /> Each in his separate cell,
          or penned in crowds<br /> For sacrifice, and struggling with fond mirth<br />
          And levity in dungeons, where the dust<br /> Was laid with tears. Then
          suddenly the scene<br /> Changed, and the unbroken dream entangled me<br />
          In long orations, which I strove to plead<br /> Before unjust
          tribunals,&mdash;with a voice<br /> Labouring, a brain confounded, and
          a sense,<br /> Death-like, of treacherous desertion, felt<br /> In the
          last place of refuge&mdash;my own soul.<br /> <br /> When I began in
          youth's delightful prime<br /> To yield myself to Nature, when that
          strong<br /> And holy passion overcame me first,<br /> Nor day nor
          night, evening or morn, was free<br /> From its oppression. But, O
          Power Supreme!<br /> Without Whose call this world would cease to
          breathe,<br /> Who from the fountain of Thy grace dost fill<br /> The
          veins that branch through every frame of life,<br /> Making man what he
          is, creature divine,<br /> In single or in social eminence,<br /> Above
          the rest raised infinite ascents<br /> When reason that enables him to
          be<br /> Is not sequestered&mdash;what a change is here!<br /> How
          different ritual for this after-worship,<br /> What countenance to
          promote this second love!<br /> The first was service paid to things
          which lie<br /> Guarded within the bosom of Thy will.<br /> Therefore to
          serve was high beatitude;<br /> Tumult was therefore gladness, and the
          fear<br /> Ennobling, venerable; sleep secure,<br /> And waking thoughts
          more rich than happiest dreams.<br /> <br /> But as the ancient
          Prophets, borne aloft<br /> In vision, yet constrained by natural laws<br />
          With them to take a troubled human heart,<br /> Wanted not
          consolations, nor a creed<br /> Of reconcilement, then when they
          denounced,<br /> On towns and cities, wallowing in the abyss<br /> Of
          their offences, punishment to come;<br /> Or saw, like other men, with
          bodily eyes,<br /> Before them, in some desolated place,<br /> The wrath
          consummate and the threat fulfilled;<br /> So, with devout humility be
          it said,<br /> So, did a portion of that spirit fall<br /> On me
          uplifted from the vantage-ground<br /> Of pity and sorrow to a state of
          being<br /> That through the time's exceeding fierceness saw<br />
          Glimpses of retribution, terrible,<br /> And in the order of sublime
          behests:<br /> But, even if that were not, amid the awe<br /> Of
          unintelligible chastisement,<br /> Not only acquiescences of faith<br />
          Survived, but daring sympathies with power,<br /> Motions not
          treacherous or profane, else why<br /> Within the folds of no ungentle
          breast<br /> Their dread vibration to this hour prolonged?<br /> Wild
          blasts of music thus could find their way<br /> Into the midst of
          turbulent events;<br /> So that worst tempests might be listened to.<br />
          Then was the truth received into my heart,<br /> That, under heaviest
          sorrow earth can bring,<br /> If from the affliction somewhere do not
          grow<br /> Honour which could not else have been, a faith,<br /> An
          elevation and a sanctity,<br /> If new strength be not given nor old
          restored,<br /> The blame is ours, not Nature's. When a taunt<br /> Was
          taken up by scoffers in their pride,<br /> Saying, "Behold the harvest
          that we reap<br /> From popular government and equality,"<br /> I
          clearly saw that neither these nor aught<br /> Of wild belief engrafted
          on their names<br /> By false philosophy had caused the woe,<br /> But a
          terrific reservoir of guilt<br /> And ignorance rilled up from age to
          age,<br /> That could no longer hold its loathsome charge,<br /> But
          burst and spread in deluge through the land.<br /> <br /> And as the
          desert hath green spots, the sea<br /> Small islands scattered amid
          stormy waves,<br /> So that disastrous period did not want<br /> Bright
          sprinklings of all human excellence,<br /> To which the silver wands of
          saints in Heaven<br /> Might point with rapturous joy. Yet not the
          less,<br /> For those examples in no age surpassed<br /> Of fortitude
          and energy and love,<br /> And human nature faithful to herself<br />
          Under worst trials, was I driven to think<br /> Of the glad times when
          first I traversed France<br /> A youthful pilgrim; above all reviewed<br />
          That eventide, when under windows bright<br /> With happy faces and
          with garlands hung,<br /> And through a rainbow-arch that spanned the
          street,<br /> Triumphal pomp for liberty confirmed,<br /> I paced, a
          dear companion at my side,<br /> The town of Arras, whence with promise
          high<br /> Issued, on delegation to sustain<br /> Humanity and right, <i>that</i>
          Robespierre,<br /> He who thereafter, and in how short time!<br />
          Wielded the sceptre of the Atheist crew.<br /> When the calamity spread
          far and wide&mdash;<br /> And this same city, that did then appear<br />
          To outrun the rest in exultation, groaned<br /> Under the vengeance of
          her cruel son,<br /> As Lear reproached the winds&mdash;I could almost<br />
          Have quarrelled with that blameless spectacle<br /> For lingering yet
          an image in my mind<br /> To mock me under such a strange reverse.<br />
          <br /> O Friend! few happier moments have been mine<br /> Than that
          which told the downfall of this Tribe<br /> So dreaded, so abhorred.
          The day deserves<br /> A separate record. Over the smooth sands<br /> Of
          Leven's ample estuary lay<br /> My journey, and beneath a genial sun,<br />
          With distant prospect among gleams of sky<br /> And clouds, and
          intermingling mountain tops,<br /> In one inseparable glory clad,<br />
          Creatures of one ethereal substance met<br /> In consistory, like a
          diadem<br /> Or crown of burning seraphs as they sit<br /> In the
          empyrean. Underneath that pomp<br /> Celestial, lay unseen the pastoral
          vales<br /> Among whose happy fields I had grown up<br /> From
          childhood. On the fulgent spectacle,<br /> That neither passed away nor
          changed, I gazed<br /> Enrapt; but brightest things are wont to draw<br />
          Sad opposites out of the inner heart,<br /> As even their pensive
          influence drew from mine.<br /> How could it otherwise? for not in vain<br />
          That very morning had I turned aside<br /> To seek the ground where,
          'mid a throng of graves,<br /> An honoured teacher of my youth was
          laid,<br /> And on the stone were graven by his desire<br /> Lines from
          the churchyard elegy of Gray.<br /> This faithful guide, speaking from
          his death-bed,<br /> Added no farewell to his parting counsel,<br /> But
          said to me, "My head will soon lie low;"<br /> And when I saw the turf
          that covered him,<br /> After the lapse of full eight years, those
          words,<br /> With sound of voice and countenance of the Man,<br /> Came
          back upon me, so that some few tears<br /> Fell from me in my own
          despite. But now<br /> I thought, still traversing that widespread
          plain,<br /> With tender pleasure of the verses graven<br /> Upon his
          tombstone, whispering to myself:<br /> He loved the Poets, and, if now
          alive,<br /> Would have loved me, as one not destitute<br /> Of promise,
          nor belying the kind hope<br /> That he had formed, when I, at his
          command,<br /> Began to spin, with toil, my earliest songs.<br /> <br />
          As I advanced, all that I saw or felt<br /> Was gentleness and peace.
          Upon a small<br /> And rocky island near, a fragment stood<br /> (Itself
          like a sea rock) the low remains<br /> (With shells encrusted, dark
          with briny weeds)<br /> Of a dilapidated structure, once<br /> A Romish
          chapel, where the vested priest<br /> Said matins at the hour that
          suited those<br /> Who crossed the sands with ebb of morning tide.<br />
          Not far from that still ruin all the plain<br /> Lay spotted with a
          variegated crowd<br /> Of vehicles and travellers, horse and foot,<br />
          Wading beneath the conduct of their guide<br /> In loose procession
          through the shallow stream<br /> Of inland waters; the great sea
          meanwhile<br /> Heaved at safe distance, far retired. I paused,<br />
          Longing for skill to paint a scene so bright<br /> And cheerful, but
          the foremost of the band<br /> As he approached, no salutation given<br />
          In the familiar language of the day,<br /> Cried, "Robespierre is
          dead!"&mdash;nor was a doubt,<br /> After strict question, left within
          my mind<br /> That he and his supporters all were fallen.<br /> <br />
          Great was my transport, deep my gratitude<br /> To everlasting Justice,
          by this fiat<br /> Made manifest. "Come now, ye golden times,"<br />
          Said I forth-pouring on those open sands<br /> A hymn of triumph: "as
          the morning comes<br /> From out the bosom of the night, come ye:<br />
          Thus far our trust is verified; behold!<br /> They who with clumsy
          desperation brought<br /> A river of Blood, and preached that nothing
          else<br /> Could cleanse the Augean stable, by the might<br /> Of their
          own helper have been swept away;<br /> Their madness stands declared
          and visible;<br /> Elsewhere will safety now be sought, and earth<br />
          March firmly towards righteousness and peace."&mdash;<br /> Then
          schemes I framed more calmly, when and how<br /> The madding factions
          might be tranquillised,<br /> And how through hardships manifold and
          long<br /> The glorious renovation would proceed.<br /> Thus interrupted
          by uneasy bursts<br /> Of exultation, I pursued my way<br /> Along that
          very shore which I had skimmed<br /> In former days, when&mdash;spurring
          from the Vale<br /> Of Nightshade, and St. Mary's mouldering fane,<br />
          And the stone abbot, after circuit made<br /> In wantonness of heart, a
          joyous band<br /> Of school-boys hastening to their distant home<br />
          Along the margin of the moonlight sea&mdash;<br /> We beat with
          thundering hoofs the level sand.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="#Ctoc">Contents&mdash;<i>The

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "One day, among the last of October, Robespierre, being summoned to the
        tribune by some new hint of that old calumny of the Dictatorship, was
        speaking and pleading there, with more and more comfort to himself; till
        rising high in heart, he cried out valiantly: Is there any man here that
        dare specifically accuse me? ''Moi!'' exclaimed one. Pause of deep
        silence: a lean angry little Figure, with broad bald brow, strode
        swiftly towards the tribune, taking papers from its pocket: 'I accuse
        thee, Robespierre,&mdash;I, Jean Baptiste Louvet!' The Seagreen became
        tallow-green; shrinking to a corner of the tribune, Danton cried,
        'Speak, Robespierre; there are many good citizens that listen;' but the
        tongue refused its office. And so Louvet, with a shrill tone, read and
        recited crime after crime: dictatorial temper, exclusive popularity,
        bullying at elections, mob-retinue, September Massacres;&mdash;till all
        the Convention shrieked again," etc. etc.

          From that time forth, Authority in France<br /> Put on a milder face;
          Terror had ceased,<br /> Yet every thing was wanting that might give<br />
          Courage to them who looked for good by light<br /> Of rational
          Experience, for the shoots<br /> And hopeful blossoms of a second
          spring:<br /> Yet, in me, confidence was unimpaired;<br /> The Senate's
          language, and the public acts<br /> And measures of the Government,
          though both<br /> Weak, and of heartless omen, had not power<br /> To
          daunt me; in the People was my trust,<br /> And, in the virtues which
          mine eyes had seen.<br /> I knew that wound external could not take<br />
          Life from the young Republic; that new foes<br /> Would only follow, in
          the path of shame,<br /> Their brethren, and her triumphs be in the end<br />
          Great, universal, irresistible.<br /> This intuition led me to confound<br />
          One victory with another, higher far,&mdash;<br /> Triumphs of
          unambitious peace at home,<br /> And noiseless fortitude. Beholding
          still<br /> Resistance strong as heretofore, I thought<br /> That what
          was in degree the same was likewise<br /> The same in quality,&mdash;that,
          as the worse<br /> Of the two spirits then at strife remained<br />
          Untired, the better, surely, would preserve<br /> The heart that first
          had roused him. Youth maintains,<br /> In all conditions of society,<br />
          Communion more direct and intimate<br /> With Nature,&mdash;hence,
          ofttimes, with reason too&mdash;<br /> Than age or manhood, even. To
          Nature, then,<br /> Power had reverted: habit, custom, law,<br /> Had
          left an interregnum's open space<br /> For <i>her</i> to move about in,
          uncontrolled.<br /> Hence could I see how Babel-like their task,<br />
          Who, by the recent deluge stupified,<br /> With their whole souls went
          culling from the day<br /> Its petty promises, to build a tower<br />
          For their own safety; laughed with my compeers<br /> At gravest heads,
          by enmity to France<br /> Distempered, till they found, in every blast<br />
          Forced from the street-disturbing newsman's horn,<br /> For her great
          cause record or prophecy<br /> Of utter ruin. How might we believe<br />
          That wisdom could, in any shape, come near<br /> Men clinging to
          delusions so insane?<br /> And thus, experience proving that no few<br />
          Of our opinions had been just, we took<br /> Like credit to ourselves
          where less was due,<br /> And thought that other notions were as sound,<br />
          Yea, could not but be right, because we saw<br /> That foolish men
          opposed them.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To a strain<br /> More animated I might here give
          way,<br /> And tell, since juvenile errors are my theme,<br /> What in
          those days, through Britain, was performed<br /> To turn <i>all</i>
          judgments out of their right course;<br /> But this is passion
          over-near ourselves,<br /> Reality too close and too intense,<br /> And
          intermixed with something, in my mind,<br /> Of scorn and condemnation
          personal,<br /> That would profane the sanctity of verse.<br /> Our
          Shepherds, this say merely, at that time<br /> Acted, or seemed at
          least to act, like men<br /> Thirsting to make the guardian crook of
          law<br /> A tool of murder; they who ruled the State,<br /> Though with
          such awful proof before their eyes<br /> That he, who would sow death,
          reaps death, or worse,<br /> And can reap nothing better, child-like
          longed<br /> To imitate, not wise enough to avoid;<br /> Or left (by
          mere timidity betrayed)<br /> The plain straight road, for one no
          better chosen<br /> Than if their wish had been to undermine<br />
          Justice, and make an end of Liberty.<br /> <br /> But from these bitter
          truths I must return<br /> To my own history. It hath been told<br />
          That I was led to take an eager part<br /> In arguments of civil
          polity,<br /> Abruptly, and indeed before my time:<br /> I had
          approached, like other youths, the shield<br /> Of human nature from
          the golden side,<br /> And would have fought, even to the death, to
          attest<br /> The quality of the metal which I saw.<br /> What there is
          best in individual man,<br /> Of wise in passion, and sublime in power,<br />
          Benevolent in small societies,<br /> And great in large ones, I had oft
          revolved,<br /> Felt deeply, but not thoroughly understood<br /> By
          reason: nay, far from it; they were yet,<br /> As cause was given me
          afterwards to learn,<br /> Not proof against the injuries of the day;<br />
          Lodged only at the sanctuary's door,<br /> Not safe within its bosom.
          Thus prepared,<br /> And with such general insight into evil,<br /> And
          of the bounds which sever it from good,<br /> As books and common
          intercourse with life<br /> Must needs have given&mdash;to the
          inexperienced mind,<br /> When the world travels in a beaten road,<br />
          Guide faithful as is needed&mdash;I began<br /> To meditate with ardour
          on the rule<br /> And management of nations; what it is<br /> And ought
          to be; and strove to learn how far<br /> Their power or weakness,
          wealth or poverty,<br /> Their happiness or misery, depends<br /> Upon
          their laws, and fashion of the State.<br /> <br /> O pleasant exercise
          of hope and joy!<br /> For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood<br />
          Upon our side, us who were strong in love!<br /> Bliss was it in that
          dawn to be alive,<br /> But to be young was very Heaven! O times,<br />
          In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways<br /> Of custom, law, and
          statute, took at once<br /> The attraction of a country in romance!<br />
          When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights<br /> When most intent
          on making of herself<br /> A prime enchantress&mdash;to assist the
          work,<br /> Which then was going forward in her name!<br /> Not favoured
          spots alone, but the whole Earth,<br /> The beauty wore of promise&mdash;that
          which sets<br /> (As at some moments might not be unfelt<br /> Among the
          bowers of Paradise itself)<br /> The budding rose above the rose full
          blown.<br /> What temper at the prospect did not wake<br /> To happiness
          unthought of? The inert<br /> Were roused, and lively natures rapt
          away!<br /> They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,<br /> The
          play-fellows of fancy, who had made<br /> All powers of swiftness,
          subtilty, and strength<br /> Their ministers,&mdash;who in lordly wise
          had stirred<br /> Among the grandest objects of the sense,<br /> And
          dealt with whatsoever they found there<br /> As if they had within some
          lurking right<br /> To wield it;&mdash;they, too, who of gentle mood<br />
          Had watched all gentle motions, and to these<br /> Had fitted their own
          thoughts, schemers more mild,<br /> And in the region of their peaceful
          selves;&mdash;<br /> Now was it that <i>both</i> found, the meek and
          lofty<br /> Did both find helpers to their hearts' desire,<br /> And
          stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish,&mdash;<br /> Were called
          upon to exercise their skill,<br /> Not in Utopia,&mdash;subterranean
          fields,&mdash;<br /> Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!<br />
          But in the very world, which is the world<br /> Of all of us,&mdash;the
          place where, in the end,<br /> We find our happiness, or not at all!<br />
          <br /> Why should I not confess that Earth was then<br /> To me, what an
          inheritance, new-fallen,<br /> Seems, when the first time visited, to
          one<br /> Who thither comes to find in it his home?<br /> He walks about
          and looks upon the spot<br /> With cordial transport, moulds it and
          remoulds,<br /> And is half pleased with things that are amiss,<br />
          'Twill be such joy to see them disappear.<br /> <br /> An active
          partisan, I thus convoked<br /> From every object pleasant circumstance<br />
          To suit my ends; I moved among mankind<br /> With genial feelings still
          predominant;<br /> When erring, erring on the better part,<br /> And in
          the kinder spirit; placable,<br /> Indulgent, as not uninformed that
          men<br /> See as they have been taught&mdash;Antiquity<br /> Gives
          rights to error; and aware, no less,<br /> That throwing off oppression
          must be work<br /> As well of License as of Liberty;<br /> And above all&mdash;for
          this was more than all&mdash;<br /> Not caring if the wind did now and
          then<br /> Blow keen upon an eminence that gave<br /> Prospect so large
          into futurity;<br /> In brief, a child of Nature, as at first,<br />
          Diffusing only those affections wider<br /> That from the cradle had
          grown up with me,<br /> And losing, in no other way than light<br /> Is
          lost in light, the weak in the more strong.<br /> <br /> In the main
          outline, such it might be said<br /> Was my condition, till with open
          war<br /> Britain opposed the liberties of France.<br /> This threw me
          first out of the pale of love;<br /> Soured and corrupted, upwards to
          the source,<br /> My sentiments; was not, as hitherto,<br /> A
          swallowing up of lesser things in great,<br /> But change of them into
          their contraries;<br /> And thus a way was opened for mistakes<br /> And
          false conclusions, in degree as gross,<br /> In kind more dangerous.
          What had been a pride,<br /> Was now a shame; my likings and my loves<br />
          Ran in new channels, leaving old ones dry;<br /> And hence a blow that,
          in maturer age,<br /> Would but have touched the judgment, struck more
          deep<br /> Into sensations near the heart: meantime,<br /> As from the
          first, wild theories were afloat,<br /> To whose pretensions,
          sedulously urged,<br /> I had but lent a careless ear, assured<br />
          That time was ready to set all things right,<br /> And that the
          multitude, so long oppressed,<br /> Would be oppressed no more.<br />
          <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          But when events<br /> Brought less encouragement, and unto these<br />
          The immediate proof of principles no more<br /> Could be entrusted,
          while the events themselves,<br /> Worn out in greatness, stripped of
          novelty,<br /> Less occupied the mind, and sentiments<br /> Could
          through my understanding's natural growth<br /> No longer keep their
          ground, by faith maintained<br /> Of inward consciousness, and hope
          that laid<br /> Her hand upon her object&mdash;evidence<br /> Safer, of
          universal application, such<br /> As could not be impeached, was sought
          elsewhere.<br /> <br /> But now, become oppressors in their turn,<br />
          Frenchmen had changed a war of self-defence<br /> For one of conquest,
          losing sight of all<br /> Which they had struggled for: now mounted up,<br />
          Openly in the eye of earth and heaven,<br /> The scale of liberty. I
          read her doom,<br /> With anger vexed, with disappointment sore,<br />
          But not dismayed, nor taking to the shame<br /> Of a false prophet.
          While resentment rose<br /> Striving to hide, what nought could heal,
          the wounds<br /> Of mortified presumption, I adhered<br /> More firmly
          to old tenets, and, to prove<br /> Their temper, strained them more;
          and thus, in heat<br /> Of contest, did opinions every day<br /> Grow
          into consequence, till round my mind<br /> They clung, as if they were
          its life, nay more,<br /> The very being of the immortal soul.<br />
          <br /> This was the time, when, all things tending fast<br /> To
          depravation, speculative schemes&mdash;<br /> That promised to abstract
          the hopes of Man<br /> Out of his feelings, to be fixed thenceforth<br />
          For ever in a purer element&mdash;<br /> Found ready welcome. Tempting
          region <i>that</i><br /> For Zeal to enter and refresh herself,<br />
          Where passions had the privilege to work,<br /> And never hear the
          sound of their own names.<br /> But, speaking more in charity, the
          dream<br /> Flattered the young, pleased with extremes, nor least<br />
          With that which makes our Reason's naked self<br /> The object of its
          fervour. What delight!<br /> How glorious! in self-knowledge and
          self-rule,<br /> To look through all the frailties of the world,<br />
          And, with a resolute mastery shaking off<br /> Infirmities of nature,
          time, and place,<br /> Build social upon personal Liberty,<br /> Which,
          to the blind restraints of general laws<br /> Superior, magisterially
          adopts<br /> One guide, the light of circumstances, flashed<br /> Upon
          an independent intellect.<br /> Thus expectation rose again; thus hope,<br />
          From her first ground expelled, grew proud once more.<br /> Oft, as my
          thoughts were turned to human kind,<br /> I scorned indifference; but,
          inflamed with thirst<br /> Of a secure intelligence, and sick<br /> Of
          other longing, I pursued what seemed<br /> A more exalted nature;
          wished that Man<br /> Should start out of his earthy, worm-like state,<br />
          And spread abroad the wings of Liberty,<br /> Lord of himself, in
          undisturbed delight&mdash;<br /> A noble aspiration! <i>yet</i> I feel<br />
          (Sustained by worthier as by wiser thoughts)<br /> The aspiration, nor
          shall ever cease<br /> To feel it;&mdash;but return we to our course.<br />
          <br /> Enough, 'tis true&mdash;could such a plea excuse<br /> Those
          aberrations&mdash;had the clamorous friends<br /> Of ancient
          Institutions said and done<br /> To bring disgrace upon their very
          names;<br /> Disgrace, of which, custom and written law,<br /> And
          sundry moral sentiments as props<br /> Or emanations of those
          institutes,<br /> Too justly bore a part. A veil had been<br />
          Uplifted; why deceive ourselves? in sooth,<br /> 'Twas even so; and
          sorrow for the man<br /> Who either had not eyes wherewith to see,<br />
          Or, seeing, had forgotten! A strong shock<br /> Was given to old
          opinions; all men's minds<br /> Had felt its power, and mine was both
          let loose,<br /> Let loose and goaded. After what hath been<br />
          Already said of patriotic love,<br /> Suffice it here to add, that,
          somewhat stern<br /> In temperament, withal a happy man,<br /> And
          therefore bold to look on painful things,<br /> Free likewise of the
          world, and thence more bold,<br /> I summoned my best skill, and
          toiled, intent<br /> To anatomise the frame of social life,<br /> Yea,
          the whole body of society<br /> Searched to its heart. Share with me,
          Friend! the wish<br /> That some dramatic tale, endued with shapes<br />
          Livelier, and flinging out less guarded words<br /> Than suit the work
          we fashion, might set forth<br /> What then I learned, or think I
          learned, of truth,<br /> And the errors into which I fell, betrayed<br />
          By present objects, and by reasonings false<br /> From their
          beginnings, inasmuch as drawn<br /> Out of a heart that had been turned
          aside<br /> From Nature's way by outward accidents,<br /> And which was
          thus confounded, more and more<br /> Misguided, and misguiding. So I
          fared,<br /> Dragging all precepts, judgments, maxims, creeds,<br />
          Like culprits to the bar; calling the mind,<br /> Suspiciously, to
          establish in plain day<br /> Her titles and her honours; now believing,<br />
          Now disbelieving; endlessly perplexed<br /> With impulse, motive, right
          and wrong, the ground<br /> Of obligation, what the rule and whence<br />
          The sanction; till, demanding formal <i>proof</i>,<br /> And seeking it
          in every thing, I lost<br /> All feeling of conviction, and, in fine,<br />
          Sick, wearied out with contrarieties,<br /> Yielded up moral questions
          in despair.<br /> <br /> This was the crisis of that strong disease,<br />
          This the soul's last and lowest ebb; I drooped,<br /> Deeming our
          blessed reason of least use<br /> Where wanted most: "The lordly
          attributes<br /> Of will and choice," I bitterly exclaimed,<br /> "What
          are they but a mockery of a Being<br /> Who hath in no concerns of his
          a test<br /> Of good and evil; knows not what to fear<br /> Or hope for,
          what to covet or to shun;<br /> And who, if those could be discerned,
          would yet<br /> Be little profited, would see, and ask<br /> Where is
          the obligation to enforce?<br /> And, to acknowledged law rebellious,
          still,<br /> As selfish passion urged, would act amiss;<br /> The dupe
          of folly, or the slave of crime."<br /> <br /> Depressed, bewildered
          thus, I did not walk<br /> With scoffers, seeking light and gay revenge<br />
          From indiscriminate laughter, nor sate down<br /> In reconcilement with
          an utter waste<br /> Of intellect; such sloth I could not brook,<br />
          (Too well I loved, in that my spring of life,<br /> Pains-taking
          thoughts, and truth, their dear reward)<br /> But turned to abstract
          science, and there sought<br /> Work for the reasoning faculty
          enthroned<br /> Where the disturbances of space and time&mdash;<br />
          Whether in matters various, properties<br /> Inherent, or from human
          will and power<br /> Derived&mdash;find no admission. Then it was&mdash;<br />
          Thanks to the bounteous Giver of all good!&mdash;<br /> That the
          beloved Sister in whose sight<br /> Those days were passed, now
          speaking in a voice<br /> Of sudden admonition&mdash;like a brook<br />
          That did but <i>cross</i> a lonely road, and now<br /> Is seen, heard,
          felt, and caught at every turn,<br /> Companion never lost through many
          a league&mdash;<br /> Maintained for me a saving intercourse<br /> With
          my true self; for, though bedimmed and changed<br /> Much, as it
          seemed, I was no further changed<br /> Than as a clouded and a waning
          moon:<br /> She whispered still that brightness would return,<br /> She,
          in the midst of all, preserved me still<br /> A Poet, made me seek
          beneath that name,<br /> And that alone, my office upon earth;<br />
          And, lastly, as hereafter will be shown,<br /> If willing audience fail
          not, Nature's self,<br /> By all varieties of human love<br /> Assisted,
          led me back through opening day<br /> To those sweet counsels between
          head and heart<br /> Whence grew that genuine knowledge, fraught with
          peace,<br /> Which, through the later sinkings of this cause,<br /> Hath
          still upheld me, and upholds me now<br /> In the catastrophe (for so
          they dream,<br /> And nothing less), when, finally to close<br /> And
          seal up all the gains of France, a Pope<br /> Is summoned in, to crown
          an Emperor&mdash;<br /> This last opprobrium, when we see a people,<br />
          That once looked up in faith, as if to Heaven<br /> For manna, take a
          lesson from the dog<br /> Returning to his vomit; when the sun<br />
          That rose in splendour, was alive, and moved<br /> In exultation with a
          living pomp<br /> Of clouds&mdash;his glory's natural retinue&mdash;<br />
          Hath dropped all functions by the gods bestowed,<br /> And, turned into
          a gewgaw, a machine,<br /> Sets like an Opera phantom.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, O
          Friend!<br /> Through times of honour and through times of shame<br />
          Descending, have I faithfully retraced<br /> The perturbations of a
          youthful mind<br /> Under a long-lived storm of great events&mdash;<br />
          A story destined for thy ear, who now,<br /> Among the fallen of
          nations, dost abide<br /> Where Etna, over hill and valley, casts<br />
          His shadow stretching towards Syracuse,<br /> The city of Timoleon!
          Righteous Heaven!<br /> How are the mighty prostrated! They first,<br />
          They first of all that breathe should have awaked<br /> When the great
          voice was heard from out the tombs<br /> Of ancient heroes. If I
          suffered grief<br /> For ill-requited France, by many deemed<br /> A
          trifler only in her proudest day;<br /> Have been distressed to think
          of what she once<br /> Promised, now is; a far more sober cause<br />
          Thine eyes must see of sorrow in a land.<br /> To the reanimating
          influence lost<br /> Of memory, to virtue lost and hope,<br /> Though
          with the wreck of loftier years bestrewn.<br /> <br /> But indignation
          works where hope is not,<br /> And thou, O Friend! wilt be refreshed.
          There is<br /> One great society alone on earth:<br /> The noble Living
          and the noble Dead.<br /> <br /> Thine be such converse strong and
          sanative,<br /> A ladder for thy spirit to reascend<br /> To health and
          joy and pure contentedness;<br /> To me the grief confined, that thou
          art gone<br /> From this last spot of earth, where Freedom now<br />
          Stands single in her only sanctuary;<br /> A lonely wanderer art gone,
          by pain<br /> Compelled and sickness, at this latter day,<br /> This
          sorrowful reverse for all mankind.<br /> I feel for thee, must utter
          what I feel:<br /> The sympathies erewhile in part discharged,<br />
          Gather afresh, and will have vent again:<br /> My own delights do
          scarcely seem to me<br /> My own delights; the lordly Alps themselves,<br />
          Those rosy peaks, from which the Morning looks<br /> Abroad on many
          nations, are no more<br /> For me that image of pure gladsomeness<br />
          Which they were wont to be. Through kindred scenes,<br /> For purpose,
          at a time, how different!<br /> Thou tak'st thy way, carrying the heart
          and soul<br /> That Nature gives to Poets, now by thought<br /> Matured,
          and in the summer of their strength.<br /> Oh! wrap him in your shades,
          ye giant woods,<br /> On Etna's side; and thou, O flowery field<br /> Of
          Enna! is there not some nook of thine,<br /> From the first play-time
          of the infant world<br /> Kept sacred to restorative delight,<br /> When
          from afar invoked by anxious love?<br /> <br /> Child of the mountains,
          among shepherds reared,<br /> Ere yet familiar with the classic page,<br />
          I learnt to dream of Sicily; and lo,<br /> The gloom, that, but a
          moment past, was deepened<br /> At thy command, at her command gives
          way;<br /> A pleasant promise, wafted from her shores,<br /> Comes o'er
          my heart: in fancy I behold<br /> Her seas yet smiling, her once happy
          vales;<br /> Nor can my tongue give utterance to a name<br /> Of note
          belonging to that honoured isle,<br /> Philosopher or Bard, Empedocles,<br />
          Or Archimedes, pure abstracted soul!<br /> That doth not yield a solace
          to my grief:<br /> And, O Theocritus, so far have some<br /> Prevailed
          among the powers of heaven and earth,<br /> By their endowments, good
          or great, that they<br /> Have had, as thou reportest, miracles<br />
          Wrought for them in old time: yea, not unmoved,<br /> When thinking on
          my own beloved friend,<br /> I hear thee tell how bees with honey fed<br />
          Divine Comates, by his impious lord<br /> Within a chest imprisoned;
          how they came<br /> Laden from blooming grove or flowery field,<br />
          And fed him there, alive, month after month,<br /> Because the
          goatherd, blessed man! had lips<br /> Wet with the Muses' nectar.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Thus I soothe<br /> The pensive moments by this calm fire-side,<br />
          And find a thousand bounteous images<br /> To cheer the thoughts of
          those I love, and mine.<br /> Our prayers have been accepted; thou wilt
          stand<br /> On Etna's summit, above earth and sea,<br /> Triumphant,
          winning from the invaded heavens<br /> Thoughts without bound,
          magnificent designs,<br /> Worthy of poets who attuned their harps<br />
          In wood or echoing cave, for discipline<br /> Of heroes; or, in
          reverence to the gods,<br /> 'Mid temples, served by sapient priests,
          and choirs<br /> Of virgins crowned with roses. Not in vain<br /> Those
          temples, where they in their ruins yet<br /> Survive for inspiration,
          shall attract<br /> Thy solitary steps: and on the brink<br /> Thou wilt
          recline of pastoral Arethuse;<br /> Or, if that fountain be in truth no
          more,<br /> Then, near some other spring&mdash;which, by the name<br />
          Thou gratulatest, willingly deceived&mdash;<br /> I see thee linger a
          glad votary,<br /> And not a captive pining for his home.<br /> <br />

      Act was suspended, a Bill was passed against seditious Assemblies, the
      Press was prosecuted, some Scottish Whigs who clamoured for reform were
      sentenced to transportation, while one Judge expressed regret that the

          Long time have human ignorance and guilt<br /> Detained us, on what
          spectacles of woe<br /> Compelled to look, and inwardly oppressed<br />
          With sorrow, disappointment, vexing thoughts,<br /> Confusion of the
          judgment, zeal decayed,<br /> And, lastly, utter loss of hope itself<br />
          And things to hope for! Not with these began<br /> Our song, and not
          with these our song must end.&mdash;<br /> Ye motions of delight, that
          haunt the sides<br /> Of the green hills; ye breezes and soft airs,<br />
          Whose subtle intercourse with breathing flowers,<br /> Feelingly
          watched, might teach Man's haughty race<br /> How without injury to
          take, to give<br /> Without offence; ye who, as if to show<br /> The
          wondrous influence of power gently used,<br /> Bend the complying heads
          of lordly pines,<br /> And, with a touch, shift the stupendous clouds<br />
          Through the whole compass of the sky; ye brooks,<br /> Muttering along
          the stones, a busy noise<br /> By day, a quiet sound in silent night;<br />
          Ye waves, that out of the great deep steal forth<br /> In a calm hour
          to kiss the pebbly shore,<br /> Not mute, and then retire, fearing no
          storm;<br /> And you, ye groves, whose ministry it is<br /> To interpose
          the covert of your shades,<br /> Even as a sleep, between the heart of
          man<br /> And outward troubles, between man himself,<br /> Not seldom,
          and his own uneasy heart:<br /> Oh! that I had a music and a voice<br />
          Harmonious as your own, that I might tell<br /> What ye have done for
          me. The morning shines,<br /> Nor heedeth Man's perverseness; Spring
          returns,&mdash;<br /> I saw the Spring return, and could rejoice,<br />
          In common with the children of her love,<br /> Piping on boughs, or
          sporting on fresh fields,<br /> Or boldly seeking pleasure nearer
          heaven<br /> On wings that navigate cerulean skies.<br /> So neither
          were complacency, nor peace,<br /> Nor tender yearnings, wanting for my
          good<br /> Through these distracted times; in Nature still<br />
          Glorying, I found a counterpoise in her,<br /> Which, when the spirit
          of evil reached its height.<br /> Maintained for me a secret happiness.<br />
          <br /> This narrative, my Friend! hath chiefly told<br /> Of
          intellectual power, fostering love,<br /> Dispensing truth, and, over
          men and things,<br /> Where reason yet might hesitate, diffusing<br />
          Prophetic sympathies of genial faith:<br /> So was I favoured&mdash;such
          my happy lot&mdash;<br /> Until that natural graciousness of mind<br />
          Gave way to overpressure from the times<br /> And their disastrous
          issues. What availed,<br /> When spells forbade the voyager to land,<br />
          That fragrant notice of a pleasant shore<br /> Wafted, at intervals,
          from many a bower<br /> Of blissful gratitude and fearless love?<br />
          Dare I avow that wish was mine to see,<br /> And hope that future times
          <i>would</i> surely see,<br /> The man to come, parted, as by a gulph,<br />
          From him who had been; that I could no more<br /> Trust the elevation
          which had made me one<br /> With the great family that still survives<br />
          To illuminate the abyss of ages past,<br /> Sage, warrior, patriot,
          hero; for it seemed<br /> That their best virtues were not free from
          taint<br /> Of something false and weak, that could not stand<br /> The
          open eye of Reason. Then I said,<br /> "Go to the Poets, they will
          speak to thee<br /> More perfectly of purer creatures;&mdash;yet<br />
          If reason be nobility in man,<br /> Can aught be more ignoble than the
          man<br /> Whom they delight in, blinded as he is<br /> By prejudice, the
          miserable slave<br /> Of low ambition or distempered love?"<br /> <br />
          In such strange passion, if I may once more<br /> Review the past, I
          warred against myself&mdash;<br /> A bigot to a new idolatry&mdash;<br />
          Like a cowled monk who hath forsworn the world,<br /> Zealously
          laboured to cut off my heart<br /> From all the sources of her former
          strength;<br /> And as, by simple waving of a wand,<br /> The wizard
          instantaneously dissolves<br /> Palace or grove, even so could I unsoul<br />
          As readily by syllogistic words<br /> Those mysteries of being which
          have made,<br /> And shall continue evermore to make,<br /> Of the whole
          human race one brotherhood.<br /> <br /> What wonder, then, if, to a
          mind so far<br /> Perverted, even the visible Universe<br /> Fell under
          the dominion of a taste<br /> Less spiritual, with microscopic view<br />
          Was scanned, as I had scanned the moral world?<br /> <br /> O Soul of
          Nature! excellent and fair!<br /> That didst rejoice with me, with whom
          I, too,<br /> Rejoiced through early youth, before the winds<br /> And
          roaring waters, and in lights and shades<br /> That marched and
          countermarched about the hills<br /> In glorious apparition, Powers on
          whom<br /> I daily waited, now all eye and now<br /> All ear; but never
          long without the heart<br /> Employed, and man's unfolding intellect:<br />
          O Soul of Nature! that, by laws divine<br /> Sustained and governed,
          still dost overflow<br /> With an impassioned life, what feeble ones<br />
          Walk on this earth! how feeble have I been<br /> When thou wert in thy
          strength! Nor this through stroke<br /> Of human suffering, such as
          justifies<br /> Remissness and inaptitude of mind,<br /> But through
          presumption; even in pleasure pleased<br /> Unworthily, disliking here,
          and there<br /> Liking; by rules of mimic art transferred<br /> To
          things above all art; but more,&mdash;for this,<br /> Although a strong
          infection of the age,<br /> Was never much my habit&mdash;giving way<br />
          To a comparison of scene with scene,<br /> Bent overmuch on superficial
          things,<br /> Pampering myself with meagre novelties<br /> Of colour and
          proportion; to the moods<br /> Of time and season, to the moral power,<br />
          The affections and the spirit of the place,<br /> Insensible. Nor only
          did the love<br /> Of sitting thus in judgment interrupt<br /> My deeper
          feelings, but another cause,<br /> More subtle and less easily
          explained,<br /> That almost seems inherent in the creature,<br /> A
          twofold frame of body and of mind.<br /> I speak in recollection of a
          time<br /> When the bodily eye, in every stage of life<br /> The most
          despotic of our senses, gained<br /> Such strength in <i>me</i> as
          often held my mind<br /> In absolute dominion. Gladly here,<br />
          Entering upon abstruser argument,<br /> Could I endeavour to unfold the
          means<br /> Which Nature studiously employs to thwart<br /> This
          tyranny, summons all the senses each<br /> To counteract the other, and
          themselves,<br /> And makes them all, and the objects with which all<br />
          Are conversant, subservient in their turn<br /> To the great ends of
          Liberty and Power.<br /> But leave we this: enough that my delights<br />
          (Such as they were) were sought insatiably.<br /> Vivid the transport,
          vivid though not profound;<br /> I roamed from hill to hill, from rock
          to rock,<br /> Still craving combinations of new forms,<br /> New
          pleasure, wider empire for the sight,<br /> Proud of her own
          endowments, and rejoiced<br /> To lay the inner faculties asleep.<br />
          Amid the turns and counterturns, the strife<br /> And various trials of
          our complex being,<br /> As we grow up, such thraldom of that sense<br />
          Seems hard to shun. And yet I knew a maid,<br /> A young enthusiast,
          who escaped these bonds;<br /> Her eye was not the mistress of her
          heart;<br /> Far less did rules prescribed by passive taste,<br /> Or
          barren intermeddling subtleties,<br /> Perplex her mind; but, wise as
          women are<br /> When genial circumstance hath favoured them,<br /> She
          welcomed what was given, and craved no more;<br /> Whate'er the scene
          presented to her view,<br /> That was the best, to that she was attuned<br />
          By her benign simplicity of life,<br /> And through a perfect happiness
          of soul,<br /> Whose variegated feelings were in this<br /> Sisters,
          that they were each some new delight.<br /> Birds in the bower, and
          lambs in the green field,<br /> Could they have known her, would have
          loved; methought<br /> Her very presence such a sweetness breathed,<br />
          That flowers, and trees, and even the silent hills,<br /> And every
          thing she looked on, should have had<br /> An intimation how she bore
          herself<br /> Towards them and to all creatures. God delights<br /> In
          such a being; for her common thoughts<br /> Are piety, her life is
          gratitude.<br /> <br /> Even like this maid, before I was called forth<br />
          From the retirement of my native hills,<br /> I loved whate'er I saw:
          nor lightly loved,<br /> But most intensely; never dreamt of aught<br />
          More grand, more fair, more exquisitely framed<br /> Than those few
          nooks to which my happy feet<br /> Were limited. I had not at that time<br />
          Lived long enough, nor in the least survived<br /> The first diviner
          influence of this world,<br /> As it appears to unaccustomed eyes.<br />
          Worshipping then among the depth of things,<br /> As piety ordained;
          could I submit<br /> To measured admiration, or to aught<br /> That
          should preclude humility and love?<br /> I felt, observed, and
          pondered; did not judge,<br /> Yea, never thought of judging; with the
          gift<br /> Of all this glory filled and satisfied.<br /> And afterwards,
          when through the gorgeous Alps<br /> Roaming, I carried with me the
          same heart:<br /> In truth, the degradation&mdash;howsoe'er<br />
          Induced, effect, in whatsoe'er degree,<br /> Of custom that prepares a
          partial scale<br /> In which the little oft outweighs the great;<br />
          Or any other cause that hath been named;<br /> Or lastly, aggravated by
          the times<br /> And their impassioned sounds, which well might make<br />
          The milder minstrelsies of rural scenes<br /> Inaudible&mdash;was
          transient; I had known<br /> Too forcibly, too early in my life,<br />
          Visitings of imaginative power<br /> For this to last: I shook the
          habit off<br /> Entirely and for ever, and again<br /> In Nature's
          presence stood, as now I stand,<br /> A sensitive being, a <i>creative</i>
          soul.<br /> <br /> There are in our existence spots of time,<br /> That
          with distinct pre-eminence retain<br /> A renovating virtue, whence,
          depressed<br /> By false opinion and contentious thought,<br /> Or aught
          of heavier or more deadly weight,<br /> In trivial occupations, and the
          round<br /> Of ordinary intercourse, our minds<br /> Are nourished and
          invisibly repaired;<br /> A virtue, by which pleasure is enhanced,<br />
          That penetrates, enables us to mount,<br /> When high, more high, and
          lifts us up when fallen.<br /> This efficacious spirit chiefly lurks<br />
          Among those passages of life that give<br /> Profoundest knowledge to
          what point, and how,<br /> The mind is lord and master&mdash;outward
          sense<br /> The obedient servant of her will. Such moments<br /> Are
          scattered everywhere, taking their date<br /> From our first childhood.
          I remember well,<br /> That once, while yet my inexperienced hand<br />
          Could scarcely hold a bridle, with proud hopes<br /> I mounted, and we
          journeyed towards the hills:<br /> An ancient servant of my father's
          house<br /> Was with me, my encourager and guide:<br /> We had not
          travelled long, ere some mischance<br /> Disjoined me from my comrade;
          and, through fear<br /> Dismounting, down the rough and stony moor<br />
          I led my horse, and, stumbling on, at length<br /> Came to a bottom,
          where in former times<br /> A murderer had been hung in iron chains.<br />
          The gibbet-mast had mouldered down, the bones<br /> And iron case were
          gone; but on the turf,<br /> Hard by, soon after that fell deed was
          wrought,<br /> Some unknown hand had carved the murderer's name.<br />
          The monumental letters were inscribed<br /> In times long past; but
          still, from year to year,<br /> By superstition of the neighbourhood,<br />
          The grass is cleared away, and to this hour<br /> The characters are
          fresh and visible:<br /> A casual glance had shown them, and I fled,<br />
          Faltering and faint, and ignorant of the road:<br /> Then, reascending
          the bare common, saw<br /> A naked pool that lay beneath the hills,<br />
          The beacon on the summit, and, more near,<br /> A girl, who bore a
          pitcher on her head,<br /> And seemed with difficult steps to force her
          way<br /> Against the blowing wind. It was, in truth,<br /> An ordinary
          sight; but I should need<br /> Colours and words that are unknown to
          man,<br /> To paint the visionary dreariness<br /> Which, while I looked
          all round for my lost guide,<br /> Invested moorland waste, and naked
          pool,<br /> The beacon crowning the lone eminence,<br /> The female and
          her garments vexed and tossed<br /> By the strong wind. When, in the
          blessed hours<br /> Of early love, the loved one at my side,<br /> I
          roamed, in daily presence of this scene,<br /> Upon the naked pool and
          dreary crags,<br /> And on the melancholy beacon, fell<br /> A spirit of
          pleasure and youth's golden gleam;<br /> And think ye not with radiance
          more sublime<br /> For these remembrances, and for the power<br /> They
          had left behind? So feeling comes in aid<br /> Of feeling, and
          diversity of strength<br /> Attends us, if but once we have been
          strong.<br /> Oh! mystery of man, from what a depth<br /> Proceed thy
          honours. I am lost, but see<br /> In simple childhood something of the
          base<br /> On which thy greatness stands; but this I feel,<br /> That
          from thyself it comes, that thou must give,<br /> Else never canst
          receive. The days gone by<br /> Return upon me almost from the dawn<br />
          Of life: the hiding-places of man's power<br /> Open; I would approach
          them, but they close.<br /> I see by glimpses now; when age comes on,<br />
          May scarcely see at all; and I would give,<br /> While yet we may, as
          far as words can give,<br /> Substance and life to what I feel,
          enshrining,<br /> Such is my hope, the spirit of the Past<br /> For
          future restoration.&mdash;Yet another<br /> Of these memorials;&mdash;<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One
          Christmas-time,<br /> On the glad eve of its dear holidays,<br />
          Feverish, and tired, and restless, I went forth<br /> Into the fields,
          impatient for the sight<br /> Of those led palfreys that should bear us
          home;<br /> My brothers and myself. There rose a crag,<br /> That, from
          the meeting-point of two highways<br /> Ascending, overlooked them
          both, far stretched;<br /> Thither, uncertain on which road to fix<br />
          My expectation, thither I repaired,<br /> Scout-like, and gained the
          summit; 'twas a day<br /> Tempestuous, dark, and wild, and on the grass<br />
          I sate half-sheltered by a naked wall;<br /> Upon my right hand couched
          a single sheep,<br /> Upon my left a blasted hawthorn stood;<br /> With
          those companions at my side, I watched,<br /> Straining my eyes
          intensely, as the mist<br /> Gave intermitting prospect of the copse<br />
          And plain beneath. Ere we to school returned,&mdash;<br /> That dreary
          time,&mdash;ere we had been ten days<br /> Sojourners in my father's
          house, he died,<br /> And I and my three brothers, orphans then,<br />
          Followed his body to the grave. The event,<br /> With all the sorrow
          that it brought, appeared<br /> A chastisement; and when I called to
          mind<br /> That day so lately past, when from the crag<br /> I looked in
          such anxiety of hope;<br /> With trite reflections of morality,<br />
          Yet in the deepest passion, I bowed low<br /> To God, Who thus
          corrected my desires;<br /> And, afterwards, the wind and sleety rain,<br />
          And all the business of the elements,<br /> The single sheep, and the
          one blasted tree,<br /> And the bleak music from that old stone wall,<br />
          The noise of wood and water, and the mist<br /> That on the line of
          each of those two roads<br /> Advanced in such indisputable shapes;<br />
          All these were kindred spectacles and sounds<br /> To which I oft
          repaired, and thence would drink,<br /> As at a fountain; and on winter
          nights,<br /> Down to this very time, when storm and rain<br /> Beat on
          my roof, or, haply, at noon-day,<br /> While in a grove I walk, whose
          lofty trees,<br /> Laden with summer's thickest foliage, rock<br /> In a
          strong wind, some working of the spirit,<br /> Some inward agitations
          thence are brought,<br /> Whate'er their office, whether to beguile<br />
          Thoughts over busy in the course they took,<br /> Or animate an hour of
          vacant ease.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="#Ctoc">Contents&mdash;<i>The

      style="color: #555555;">The year was evidently 1783, but the locality is
      difficult to determine. It may have been one or other of two places.
      Wordsworth's father died at Penrith, and it was there that the sons went
      for their Christmas holiday. The road from Penrith to Hawkshead was by
      Kirkstone Pass, and Ambleside; and the "led palfreys" sent to take the
      boys home would certainly come through the latter town. Now there are only
      two roads from Ambleside to Hawkshead, which meet at a point about a mile
      north of Hawkshead, called in the Ordnance map "Outgate." The eastern road
      is now chiefly used by carriages, being less hilly and better made than
      the western one. The latter would be quite as convenient as the former for
      horses. If one were to walk out from Hawkshead village to the place where
      the two roads separate at "Outgate," and then ascend the ridge between
      them, he would find several places from which he could overlook <i>both</i>
      roads "far stretched," were the view not now intercepted by numerous
      plantations. (The latter are of comparatively recent growth.) Dr. Cradock,&mdash;to
      whom I am indebted for this, and for many other suggestions as to
      localities alluded to by Wordsworth,&mdash;thinks that </span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "a point, marked on the map as <i>High Crag</i> between the two roads,
        and about three-quarters of a mile from their point of divergence,
        answers the description as well as any other. It may be nearly two miles
        from Hawkshead, a distance of which an active eager school-boy would
        think nothing. The <i>blasted hawthorn</i> and the <i>naked wall</i> are
        probably things of the past as much as the <i>single sheep.</i>"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">Doubtless this may be the spot,&mdash;a
      green, rocky knoll with a steep face to the north, where a quarry is
      wrought, and with a plantation to the east. It commands a view of both
      roads. The other possible place is a crag, not a quarter of a mile from
      Outgate, a little to the right of the place where the two roads divide. A
      low wall runs up across it to the top, dividing a plantation of oak,
      hazel, and ash, from the firs that crown the summit. These firs, which are
      larch and spruce, seem all of this century. The top of the crag may have
      been bare when Wordsworth lived at Hawkshead. But at the foot of the path
      along the dividing wall there are a few (probably older) trees; and a
      solitary walk beneath them, at noon or dusk, is almost as suggestive to
      the imagination, as repose under the yews of Borrowdale, listening to "the
      mountain flood" on Glaramara. There one may still hear the bleak music
      from the old stone wall, and "the noise of wood and water," while the loud
      dry wind whistles through the underwood, or moans amid the fir trees of
      the Crag, on the summit of which there is a "blasted hawthorn" tree. It
      may be difficult now to determine the precise spot to which the boy
      Wordsworth climbed on that eventful day&mdash;afterwards so significant to
      him, and from the events of which, he says, he drank "as at a fountain"&mdash;but
      I think it may have been to one or other of these two crags. (See,
      however, Mr. Rawnsley's conjecture in <a href="#section33">Note V.</a> in
      the <a href="#section28">Appendix</a> to this volume, p. 391.)&mdash;Ed.</span><br />

          From Nature doth emotion come, and moods<br /> Of calmness equally are
          Nature's gift:<br /> This is her glory; these two attributes<br /> Are
          sister horns that constitute her strength.<br /> Hence Genius, born to
          thrive by interchange<br /> Of peace and excitation, finds in her<br />
          His best and purest friend; from her receives<br /> That energy by
          which he seeks the truth,<br /> From her that happy stillness of the
          mind<br /> Which fits him to receive it when unsought.<br /> <br /> Such
          benefit the humblest intellects<br /> Partake of, each in their degree;
          'tis mine<br /> To speak, what I myself have known and felt;<br />
          Smooth task! for words find easy way, inspired<br /> By gratitude, and
          confidence in truth.<br /> Long time in search of knowledge did I range<br />
          The field of human life, in heart and mind<br /> Benighted; but, the
          dawn beginning now<br /> To re-appear, 'twas proved that not in vain<br />
          I had been taught to reverence a Power<br /> That is the visible
          quality and shape<br /> And image of right reason; that matures<br />
          Her processes by steadfast laws; gives birth<br /> To no impatient or
          fallacious hopes,<br /> No heat of passion or excessive zeal,<br /> No
          vain conceits; provokes to no quick turns<br /> Of self-applauding
          intellect; but trains<br /> To meekness, and exalts by humble faith;<br />
          Holds up before the mind intoxicate<br /> With present objects, and the
          busy dance<br /> Of things that pass away, a temperate show<br /> Of
          objects that endure; and by this course<br /> Disposes her, when
          over-fondly set<br /> On throwing off incumbrances, to seek<br /> In
          man, and in the frame of social life,<br /> Whate'er there is desirable
          and good<br /> Of kindred permanence, unchanged in form<br /> And
          function, or, through strict vicissitude<br /> Of life and death,
          revolving. Above all<br /> Were re-established now those watchful
          thoughts<br /> Which, seeing little worthy or sublime<br /> In what the
          Historian's pen so much delights<br /> To blazon&mdash;power and energy
          detached<br /> From moral purpose&mdash;early tutored me<br /> To look
          with feelings of fraternal love<br /> Upon the unassuming things that
          hold<br /> A silent station in this beauteous world.<br /> <br /> Thus
          moderated, thus composed, I found<br /> Once more in Man an object of
          delight,<br /> Of pure imagination, and of love;<br /> And, as the
          horizon of my mind enlarged,<br /> Again I took the intellectual eye<br />
          For my instructor, studious more to see<br /> Great truths, than touch
          and handle little ones.<br /> Knowledge was given accordingly; my trust<br />
          Became more firm in feelings that had stood<br /> The test of such a
          trial; clearer far<br /> My sense of excellence&mdash;of right and
          wrong:<br /> The promise of the present time retired<br /> Into its true
          proportion; sanguine schemes,<br /> Ambitious projects, pleased me
          less; I sought<br /> For present good in life's familiar face,<br /> And
          built thereon my hopes of good to come.<br /> <br /> With settling
          judgments now of what would last<br /> And what would disappear;
          prepared to find<br /> Presumption, folly, madness, in the men<br /> Who
          thrust themselves upon the passive world<br /> As Rulers of the world;
          to see in these,<br /> Even when the public welfare is their aim,<br />
          Plans without thought, or built on theories<br /> Vague and unsound;
          and having brought the books<br /> Of modern statists to their proper
          test,<br /> Life, human life, with all its sacred claims<br /> Of sex
          and age, and heaven-descended rights,<br /> Mortal, or those beyond the
          reach of death;<br /> And having thus discerned how dire a thing<br />
          Is worshipped in that idol proudly named<br /> "The Wealth of Nations,"
          <i>where</i> alone that wealth<br /> Is lodged, and how increased; and
          having gained<br /> A more judicious knowledge of the worth<br /> And
          dignity of individual man,<br /> No composition of the brain, but man<br />
          Of whom we read, the man whom we behold<br /> With our own eyes&mdash;I
          could not but inquire&mdash;<br /> Not with less interest than
          heretofore,<br /> But greater, though in spirit more subdued&mdash;<br />
          Why is this glorious creature to be found<br /> One only in ten
          thousand? What one is,<br /> Why may not millions be? What bars are
          thrown<br /> By Nature in the way of such a hope?<br /> Our animal
          appetites and daily wants,<br /> Are these obstructions insurmountable?<br />
          If not, then others vanish into air.<br /> "Inspect the basis of the
          social pile:<br /> Inquire," said I, "how much of mental power<br /> And
          genuine virtue they possess who live<br /> By bodily toil, labour
          exceeding far<br /> Their due proportion, under all the weight<br /> Of
          that injustice which upon ourselves<br /> Ourselves entail." Such
          estimate to frame<br /> I chiefly looked (what need to look beyond?)<br />
          Among the natural abodes of men,<br /> Fields with their rural works;
          recalled to mind<br /> My earliest notices; with these compared<br />
          The observations made in later youth,<br /> And to that day continued.&mdash;For,
          the time<br /> Had never been when throes of mighty Nations<br /> And
          the world's tumult unto me could yield,<br /> How far soe'er
          transported and possessed,<br /> Full measure of content; but still I
          craved<br /> An intermingling of distinct regards<br /> And truths of
          individual sympathy<br /> Nearer ourselves. Such often might be gleaned<br />
          From the great City, else it must have proved<br /> To me a
          heart-depressing wilderness;<br /> But much was wanting: therefore did
          I turn<br /> To you, ye pathways, and ye lonely roads;<br /> Sought you
          enriched with everything I prized,<br /> With human kindnesses and
          simple joys.<br /> <br /> Oh! next to one dear state of bliss,
          vouchsafed<br /> Alas! to few in this untoward world,<br /> The bliss of
          walking daily in life's prime<br /> Through field or forest with the
          maid we love,<br /> While yet our hearts are young, while yet we
          breathe<br /> Nothing but happiness, in some lone nook,<br /> Deep vale,
          or any where, the home of both,<br /> From which it would be misery to
          stir:<br /> Oh! next to such enjoyment of our youth,<br /> In my esteem,
          next to such dear delight,<br /> Was that of wandering on from day to
          day<br /> Where I could meditate in peace, and cull<br /> Knowledge that
          step by step might lead me on<br /> To wisdom; or, as lightsome as a
          bird<br /> Wafted upon the wind from distant lands,<br /> Sing notes of
          greeting to strange fields or groves,<br /> Which lacked not voice to
          welcome me in turn:<br /> And, when that pleasant toil had ceased to
          please,<br /> Converse with men, where if we meet a face<br /> We almost
          meet a friend, on naked heaths<br /> With long long ways before, by
          cottage bench,<br /> Or well-spring where the weary traveller rests.<br />
          <br /> Who doth not love to follow with his eye<br /> The windings of a
          public way? the sight,<br /> Familiar object as it is, hath wrought<br />
          On my imagination since the morn<br /> Of childhood, when a
          disappearing line,<br /> One daily present to my eyes, that crossed<br />
          The naked summit of a far-off hill<br /> Beyond the limits that my feet
          had trod,<br /> Was like an invitation into space<br /> Boundless, or
          guide into eternity.<br /> Yes, something of the grandeur which invests<br />
          The mariner who sails the roaring sea<br /> Through storm and darkness,
          early in my mind<br /> Surrounded, too, the wanderers of the earth;<br />
          Grandeur as much, and loveliness far more.<br /> Awed have I been by
          strolling Bedlamites;<br /> From many other uncouth vagrants (passed<br />
          In fear) have walked with quicker step; but why<br /> Take note of
          this? When I began to enquire,<br /> To watch and question those I met,
          and speak<br /> Without reserve to them, the lonely roads<br /> Were
          open schools in which I daily read<br /> With most delight the passions
          of mankind,<br /> Whether by words, looks, sighs, or tears, revealed;<br />
          There saw into the depth of human souls,<br /> Souls that appear to
          have no depth at all<br /> To careless eyes. And-now convinced at heart<br />
          How little those formalities, to which<br /> With overweening trust
          alone we give<br /> The name of Education, have to do<br /> With real
          feeling and just sense; how vain<br /> A correspondence with the
          talking world<br /> Proves to the most; and called to make good search<br />
          If man's estate, by doom of Nature yoked<br /> With toil, be therefore
          yoked with ignorance;<br /> If virtue be indeed so hard to rear,<br />
          And intellectual strength so rare a boon&mdash;<br /> I prized such
          walks still more, for there I found<br /> Hope to my hope, and to my
          pleasure peace<br /> And steadiness, and healing and repose<br /> To
          every angry passion. There I heard,<br /> From mouths of men obscure
          and lowly, truths<br /> Replete with honour; sounds in unison<br /> With
          loftiest promises of good and fair.<br /> <br /> There are who think
          that strong affection, love<br /> Known by whatever name, is falsely
          deemed<br /> A gift, to use a term which they would use,<br /> Of vulgar
          nature; that its growth requires<br /> Retirement, leisure, language
          purified<br /> By manners studied and elaborate;<br /> That whoso feels
          such passion in its strength<br /> Must live within the very light and
          air<br /> Of courteous usages refined by art.<br /> True is it, where
          oppression worse than death<br /> Salutes the being at his birth, where
          grace<br /> Of culture hath been utterly unknown,<br /> And poverty and
          labour in excess<br /> From day to day pre-occupy the ground<br /> Of
          the affections, and to Nature's self<br /> Oppose a deeper nature;
          there, indeed,<br /> Love cannot be; nor does it thrive with ease<br />
          Among the close and overcrowded haunts<br /> Of cities, where the human
          heart is sick,<br /> And the eye feeds it not, and cannot feed.<br />
          &mdash;Yes, in those wanderings deeply did I feel<br /> How we mislead
          each other; above all,<br /> How books mislead us, seeking their reward<br />
          From judgments of the wealthy Few, who see<br /> By artificial lights;
          how they debase<br /> The Many for the pleasure of those Few;<br />
          Effeminately level down the truth<br /> To certain general notions, for
          the sake<br /> Of being understood at once, or else<br /> Through want
          of better knowledge in the heads<br /> That framed them; nattering
          self-conceit with words,<br /> That, while they most ambitiously set
          forth<br /> Extrinsic differences, the outward marks<br /> Whereby
          society has parted man<br /> From man, neglect the universal heart.<br />
          <br /> Here, calling up to mind what then I saw,<br /> A youthful
          traveller, and see daily now<br /> In the familiar circuit of my home,<br />
          Here might I pause, and bend in reverence<br /> To Nature, and the
          power of human minds,<br /> To men as they are men within themselves.<br />
          How oft high service is performed within,<br /> When all the external
          man is rude in show,&mdash;<br /> Not like a temple rich with pomp and
          gold,<br /> But a mere mountain chapel, that protects<br /> Its simple
          worshippers from sun and shower.<br /> Of these, said I, shall be my
          song; of these,<br /> If future years mature me for the task,<br /> Will
          I record the praises, making verse<br /> Deal boldly with substantial
          things; in truth<br /> And sanctity of passion, speak of these,<br />
          That justice may be done, obeisance paid<br /> Where it is due: thus
          haply shall I teach,<br /> Inspire, through unadulterated ears<br />
          Pour rapture, tenderness, and hope,&mdash;my theme<br /> No other than
          the very heart of man,<br /> As found among the best of those who live,<br />
          Not unexalted by religious faith,<br /> Nor uninformed by books, good
          books, though few,<br /> In Nature's presence: thence may I select<br />
          Sorrow, that is not sorrow, but delight;<br /> And miserable love, that
          is not pain<br /> To hear of, for the glory that redounds<br />
          Therefrom to human kind, and what we are.<br /> Be mine to follow with
          no timid step<br /> Where knowledge leads me: it shall be my pride<br />
          That I have dared to tread this holy ground,<br /> Speaking no dream,
          but things oracular;<br /> Matter not lightly to be heard by those<br />
          Who to the letter of the outward promise<br /> Do read the invisible
          soul; by men adroit<br /> In speech, and for communion with the world<br />
          Accomplished; minds whose faculties are then<br /> Most active when
          they are most eloquent,<br /> And elevated most when most admired.<br />
          Men may be found of other mould than these,<br /> Who are their own
          upholders, to themselves<br /> Encouragement, and energy, and will,<br />
          Expressing liveliest thoughts in lively words<br /> As native passion
          dictates. Others, too,<br /> There are among the walks of homely life<br />
          Still higher, men for contemplation framed,<br /> Shy, and unpractised
          in the strife of phrase;<br /> Meek men, whose very souls perhaps would
          sink<br /> Beneath them, summoned to such intercourse:<br /> Theirs is
          the language of the heavens, the power,<br /> The thought, the image,
          and the silent joy:<br /> Words are but under-agents in their souls;<br />
          When they are grasping with their greatest strength,<br /> They do not
          breathe among them: this I speak<br /> In gratitude to God, Who feeds
          our hearts<br /> For His own service; knoweth, loveth us,<br /> When we
          are unregarded by the world.<br /> <br /> Also, about this time did I
          receive<br /> Convictions still more strong than heretofore,<br /> Not
          only that the inner frame is good,<br /> And graciously composed, but
          that, no less,<br /> Nature for all conditions wants not power<br /> To
          consecrate, if we have eyes to see,<br /> The outside of her creatures,
          and to breathe<br /> Grandeur upon the very humblest face<br /> Of human
          life. I felt that the array<br /> Of act and circumstance, and visible
          form,<br /> Is mainly to the pleasure of the mind<br /> What passion
          makes them; that meanwhile the forms<br /> Of Nature have a passion in
          themselves,<br /> That intermingles with those works of man<br /> To
          which she summons him; although the works<br /> Be mean, have nothing
          lofty of their own;<br /> And that the Genius of the Poet hence<br />
          May boldly take his way among mankind<br /> Wherever Nature leads; that
          he hath stood<br /> By Nature's side among the men of old,<br /> And so
          shall stand for ever. Dearest Friend!<br /> If thou partake the
          animating faith<br /> That Poets, even as Prophets, each with each<br />
          Connected in a mighty scheme of truth,<br /> Have each his own peculiar
          faculty,<br /> Heaven's gift, a sense that fits him to perceive<br />
          Objects unseen before, thou wilt not blame<br /> The humblest of this
          band who dares to hope<br /> That unto him hath also been vouchsafed<br />
          An insight that in some sort he possesses,<br /> A privilege whereby a
          work of his,<br /> Proceeding from a source of untaught things,<br />
          Creative and enduring, may become<br /> A power like one of Nature's.
          To a hope<br /> Not less ambitious once among the wilds<br /> Of Sarum's
          Plain, my youthful spirit was raised;<br /> There, as I ranged at will
          the pastoral downs<br /> Trackless and smooth, or paced the bare white
          roads<br /> Lengthening in solitude their dreary line,<br /> Time with
          his retinue of ages fled<br /> Backwards, nor checked his flight until
          I saw<br /> Our dim ancestral Past in vision clear;<br /> Saw multitudes
          of men, and, here and there,<br /> A single Briton clothed in wolf-skin
          vest,<br /> With shield and stone-axe, stride across the wold;<br /> The
          voice of spears was heard, the rattling spear<br /> Shaken by arms of
          mighty bone, in strength,<br /> Long mouldered, of barbaric majesty.<br />
          I called on Darkness&mdash;but before the word<br /> Was uttered,
          midnight darkness seemed to take<br /> All objects from my sight; and
          lo! again<br /> The Desert visible by dismal flames;<br /> It is the
          sacrificial altar, fed<br /> With living men&mdash;how deep the groans!
          the voice<br /> Of those that crowd the giant wicker thrills<br /> The
          monumental hillocks, and the pomp<br /> Is for both worlds, the living
          and the dead.<br /> At other moments (for through that wide waste<br />
          Three summer days I roamed) where'er the Plain<br /> Was figured o'er
          with circles, lines, or mounds,<br /> That yet survive, a work, as some
          divine,<br /> Shaped by the Druids, so to represent<br /> Their
          knowledge of the heavens, and image forth<br /> The constellations;
          gently was I charmed<br /> Into a waking dream, a reverie<br /> That,
          with believing eyes, where'er I turned,<br /> Beheld long-bearded
          teachers, with white wands<br /> Uplifted, pointing to the starry sky,<br />
          Alternately, and plain below, while breath<br /> Of music swayed their
          motions, and the waste<br /> Rejoiced with them and me in those sweet
          sounds.<br /> <br /> This for the past, and things that may be viewed<br />
          Or fancied in the obscurity of years<br /> From monumental hints: and
          thou, O Friend!<br /> Pleased with some unpremeditated strains<br />
          That served those wanderings to beguile, hast said<br /> That then and
          there my mind had exercised<br /> Upon the vulgar forms of present
          things,<br /> The actual world of our familiar days,<br /> Yet higher
          power; had caught from them a tone,<br /> An image, and a character, by
          books<br /> Not hitherto reflected. Call we this<br /> A partial
          judgment&mdash;and yet why? for <i>then</i><br /> We were as strangers;
          and I may not speak<br /> Thus wrongfully of verse, however rude,<br />
          Which on thy young imagination, trained<br /> In the great City, broke
          like light from far.<br /> Moreover, each man's Mind is to herself<br />
          Witness and judge; and I remember well<br /> That in life's every-day
          appearances<br /> I seemed about this time to gain clear sight<br /> Of
          a new world&mdash;a world, too, that was fit<br /> To be transmitted,
          and to other eyes<br /> Made visible; as ruled by those fixed laws<br />
          Whence spiritual dignity originates,<br /> Which do both give it being
          and maintain<br /> A balance, an ennobling interchange<br /> Of action
          from without and from within;<br /> The excellence, pure function, and
          best power<br /> Both of the object seen, and eye that sees.<br /> <br />

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Is he absolutely right in attributing these powers to the objects of
        Nature, which are only symbols after all? Is there not a more
        penetrative and ethereal perceptive power in the human mind, which is
        able to transfer itself immediately to the spiritual plane, transcending
        that of visible Nature? Plato saw it; the old Vedantist still more
        clearly&mdash;and what is more&mdash;reached it. He arrived at the
        knowledge and perception of essential Being: though he could neither
        define nor limit, in a human formula, because it is undefinable and
        illimitable, but positive and abstract, universally diffused, <i>smaller
        than small, greater than great,</i> the internal Light, Monitor, Guide,
        Rest, waiting to be seen, recognised, and known in every heart; not
        depending on the powers of Nature for enlightenment and instruction, but
        itself enlightening and instructing: not merely a receptive, but the
        motive power of Nature; which bestows <i>itself</i> upon Nature, and
        only receives from it that which it bestows. Is it not, as he says
        farther on, better <i>to see great truths,</i> even if not so strictly
        in line and form, <i>touch and handle little ones,</i> to take the
        highest point of view we can reach, not a lower one? And surely it is a
        higher thing to rule over and subdue Nature, than to lie ruled and
        subdued by it? The highest form of Religion has always done this."

      style="color: #555555;">For a hint in reference to this road, I am
      indebted to the late Dr. Henry Dodgson of Cockermouth. Referring to my
      suggestion that it might be the road from Cockermouth to Bridekirk, he
      wrote (July 1878), </span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I scarcely think that road answers to the description. The hill over
        which it goes is not naked but well wooded, and has probably been so for
        many years. Besides, it is not visible from Wordsworth's house, nor from
        the garden behind it. This garden extends from the house to the river
        Derwent, from which it is separated by a wall, with a raised terraced
        walk on the inner side, and nearly on a level with the top. I understand
        that this terrace was in existence in the poet's time.... Its direction
        is nearly due east and west; and looking eastward from it, there is a
        hill which bounds the view in that direction, and which fully
        corresponds to the description in <i>The Prelude</i>. It is from one and
        a half to two miles distant, of considerable height, is bare and
        destitute of trees, and has a road going directly over its summit, as
        seen from the terrace in Wordsworth's garden. This road is now used only
        as a footpath; but, fifty or sixty years ago it was the highroad to
        Isel, a hamlet on the Derwent, about three and a half miles from
        Cockermouth, in the direction of Bassenthwaite Lake. The hill is locally
        called <i>the Hay,</i> but on the Ordnance map it is marked <i>Watch
        Hill.</i>"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">There can be little doubt as to the accuracy
      of this suggestion. No other hill-road is visible from the house or garden
      at Cockermouth. The view from the front of the old mansion is limited by
      houses, doubtless more so now than in last century; but there is no hill
      towards the Lorton Fells on the south or south-east, with a road over it,
      visible from any part of the town. Besides, as this was a very early
      experience of Wordsworth's&mdash;it was in "the morn of childhood" that
      the road was "daily present to his sight"&mdash;it must have been seen,
      either from the house or from the garden. It is almost certain that he
      refers to the path over the Hay or Watch Hill, which he and his "sister
      Emmeline" could see daily from the high terrace, at the foot of their
      garden in Cockermouth, where they used to "chase the butterfly" and visit
      the "sparrow's nest" in the "impervious shelter" of privet and roses.<br />
      <br /> Dr. Cradock wrote to me (January 1886), </span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "an old map of the county round about Keswick, including Cockermouth,
        dated 1789, entirely confirms Dr. Dodgson's statement. The road over <i>Hay
        Hill</i> is marked clearly as a carriage road to Isel. The miles are
        marked on the map. The <i>summit</i> of the hill is <i>naked:</i> for
        the map marks woods, where they existed, and none are marked on Hay
        Hill."

          In one of those excursions (may they ne'er<br /> Fade from
          remembrance!) through the Northern tracts<br /> Of Cambria ranging with
          a youthful friend,<br /> I left Bethgelert's huts at couching-time,<br />
          And westward took my way, to see the sun<br /> Rise from the top of
          Snowdon. To the door<br /> Of a rude cottage at the mountain's base<br />
          We came, and roused the shepherd who attends<br /> The adventurous
          stranger's steps, a trusty guide;<br /> Then, cheered by short
          refreshment, sallied forth.<br /> <br /> It was a close, warm,
          breezeless summer night,<br /> Wan, dull, and glaring, with a dripping
          fog<br /> Low-hung and thick that covered all the sky;<br /> But,
          undiscouraged, we began to climb<br /> The mountain-side. The mist soon
          girt us round,<br /> And, after ordinary travellers' talk<br /> With our
          conductor, pensively we sank<br /> Each into commerce with his private
          thoughts:<br /> Thus did we breast the ascent, and by myself<br /> Was
          nothing either seen or heard that checked<br /> Those musings or
          diverted, save that once<br /> The shepherd's lurcher, who, among the
          crags,<br /> Had to his joy unearthed a hedgehog, teased<br /> His
          coiled-up prey with barkings turbulent.<br /> This small adventure, for
          even such it seemed<br /> In that wild place and at the dead of night,<br />
          Being over and forgotten, on we wound<br /> In silence as before. With
          forehead bent<br /> Earthward, as if in opposition set<br /> Against an
          enemy, I panted up<br /> With eager pace, and no less eager thoughts.<br />
          Thus might we wear a midnight hour away,<br /> Ascending at loose
          distance each from each,<br /> And I, as chanced, the foremost of the
          band;<br /> When at my feet the ground appeared to brighten,<br /> And
          with a step or two seemed brighter still;<br /> Nor was time given to
          ask or learn the cause,<br /> For instantly a light upon the turf<br />
          Fell like a flash, and lo! as I looked up,<br /> The Moon hung naked in
          a firmament<br /> Of azure without cloud, and at my feet<br /> Rested a
          silent sea of hoary mist.<br /> A hundred hills their dusky backs
          upheaved<br /> All over this still ocean; and beyond,<br /> Far, far
          beyond, the solid vapours stretched,<br /> In headlands, tongues, and
          promontory shapes,<br /> Into the main Atlantic, that appeared<br /> To
          dwindle, and give up his majesty,<br /> Usurped upon far as the sight
          could reach.<br /> Not so the ethereal vault; encroachment none<br />
          Was there, nor loss; only the inferior stars<br /> Had disappeared, or
          shed a fainter light<br /> In the clear presence of the full-orbed
          Moon,<br /> Who, from her sovereign elevation, gazed<br /> Upon the
          billowy ocean, as it lay<br /> All meek and silent, save that through a
          rift&mdash;<br /> Not distant from the shore whereon we stood,<br /> A
          fixed, abysmal, gloomy, breathing-place&mdash;<br /> Mounted the roar
          of waters, torrents, streams<br /> Innumerable, roaring with one voice!<br />
          Heard over earth and sea, and, in that hour,<br /> For so it seemed,
          felt by the starry heavens.<br /> <br /> When into air had partially
          dissolved<br /> That vision, given to spirits of the night<br /> And
          three chance human wanderers, in calm thought<br /> Reflected, it
          appeared to me the type<br /> Of a majestic intellect, its acts<br />
          And its possessions, what it has and craves,<br /> What in itself it
          is, and would become.<br /> There I beheld the emblem of a mind<br />
          That feeds upon infinity, that broods<br /> Over the dark abyss, intent
          to hear<br /> Its voices issuing forth to silent light<br /> In one
          continuous stream; a mind sustained<br /> By recognitions of
          transcendent power,<br /> In sense conducting to ideal form,<br /> In
          soul of more than mortal privilege.<br /> One function, above all, of
          such a mind<br /> Had Nature shadowed there, by putting forth,<br />
          'Mid circumstances awful and sublime,<br /> That mutual domination
          which she loves<br /> To exert upon the face of outward things,<br /> So
          moulded, joined, abstracted, so endowed<br /> With interchangeable
          supremacy,<br /> That men, least sensitive, see, hear, perceive,<br />
          And cannot choose but feel. The power, which all<br /> Acknowledge when
          thus moved, which Nature thus<br /> To bodily sense exhibits, is the
          express<br /> Resemblance of that glorious faculty<br /> That higher
          minds bear with them as their own.<br /> This is the very spirit in
          which they deal<br /> With the whole compass of the universe:<br /> They
          from their native selves can send abroad<br /> Kindred mutations; for
          themselves create<br /> A like existence; and, whene'er it dawns<br />
          Created for them, catch it, or are caught<br /> By its inevitable
          mastery,<br /> Like angels stopped upon the wind by sound<br /> Of
          harmony from Heaven's remotest spheres.<br /> Them the enduring and the
          transient both<br /> Serve to exalt; they build up greatest things<br />
          From least suggestions; ever on the watch,<br /> Willing to work and to
          be wrought upon,<br /> They need not extraordinary calls<br /> To rouse
          them; in a world of life they live,<br /> By sensible impressions not
          enthralled,<br /> But by their quickening impulse made more prompt<br />
          To hold fit converse with the spiritual world,<br /> And with the
          generations of mankind<br /> Spread over time, past, present, and to
          come,<br /> Age after age, till Time shall be no more.<br /> Such minds
          are truly from the Deity,<br /> For they are Powers; and hence the
          highest bliss<br /> That flesh can know is theirs&mdash;the
          consciousness<br /> Of Whom they are, habitually infused<br /> Through
          every image and through every thought,<br /> And all affections by
          communion raised<br /> From earth to heaven, from human to divine;<br />
          Hence endless occupation for the Soul,<br /> Whether discursive or
          intuitive;<br /> Hence cheerfulness for acts of daily life,<br />
          Emotions which best foresight need not fear,<br /> Most worthy then of
          trust when most intense<br /> Hence, amid ills that vex and wrongs that
          crush<br /> Our hearts&mdash;if here the words of Holy Writ<br /> May
          with fit reverence be applied&mdash;that peace<br /> Which passeth
          understanding, that repose<br /> In moral judgments which from this
          pure source<br /> Must come, or will by man be sought in vain.<br />
          <br /> Oh! who is he that hath his whole life long<br /> Preserved,
          enlarged, this freedom in himself?<br /> For this alone is genuine
          liberty:<br /> Where is the favoured being who hath held<br /> That
          course unchecked, unerring, and untired,<br /> In one perpetual
          progress smooth and bright?&mdash;<br /> A humbler destiny have we
          retraced,<br /> And told of lapse and hesitating choice,<br /> And
          backward wanderings along thorny ways:<br /> Yet&mdash;compassed round
          by mountain solitudes,<br /> Within whose solemn temple I received<br />
          My earliest visitations, careless then<br /> Of what was given me; and
          which now I range,<br /> A meditative, oft a suffering man&mdash;<br />
          Do I declare&mdash;in accents which, from truth<br /> Deriving cheerful
          confidence, shall blend<br /> Their modulation with these vocal streams&mdash;<br />
          That, whatsoever falls my better mind,<br /> Revolving with the
          accidents of life,<br /> May have sustained, that, howsoe'er misled,<br />
          Never did I, in quest of right and wrong,<br /> Tamper with conscience
          from a private aim;<br /> Nor was in any public hope the dupe<br /> Of
          selfish passions; nor did ever yield<br /> Wilfully to mean cares or
          low pursuits,<br /> But shrunk with apprehensive jealousy<br /> From
          every combination which might aid<br /> The tendency, too potent in
          itself,<br /> Of use and custom to bow down the soul<br /> Under a
          growing weight of vulgar sense,<br /> And substitute a universe of
          death<br /> For that which moves with light and life informed,<br />
          Actual, divine, and true. To fear and love,<br /> To love as prime and
          chief, for there fear ends,<br /> Be this ascribed; to early
          intercourse,<br /> In presence of sublime or beautiful forms,<br /> With
          the adverse principles of pain and joy&mdash;<br /> Evil, as one is
          rashly named by men<br /> Who know not what they speak. By love
          subsists<br /> All lasting grandeur, by pervading love;<br /> That gone,
          we are as dust.&mdash;Behold the fields<br /> In balmy spring-time full
          of rising flowers<br /> And joyous creatures; see that pair, the lamb<br />
          And the lamb's mother, and their tender ways<br /> Shall touch thee to
          the heart; thou callest this love,<br /> And not inaptly so, for love
          it is,<br /> Far as it carries thee. In some green bower<br /> Rest, and
          be not alone, but have thou there<br /> The One who is thy choice of
          all the world:<br /> There linger, listening, gazing, with delight<br />
          Impassioned, but delight how pitiable!<br /> Unless this love by a
          still higher love<br /> Be hallowed, love that breathes not without
          awe;<br /> Love that adores, but on the knees of prayer,<br /> By heaven
          inspired; that frees from chains the soul,<br /> Lifted, in union with
          the purest, best,<br /> Of earth-born passions, on the wings of praise<br />
          Bearing a tribute to the Almighty's Throne.<br /> <br /> This spiritual
          Love acts not nor can exist<br /> Without Imagination, which, in truth,<br />
          Is but another name for absolute power<br /> And clearest insight,
          amplitude of mind,<br /> And Reason in her most exalted mood.<br /> This
          faculty hath been the feeding source<br /> Of our long labour: we have
          traced the stream<br /> From the blind cavern whence is faintly heard<br />
          Its natal murmur; followed it to light<br /> And open day; accompanied
          its course<br /> Among the ways of Nature, for a time<br /> Lost sight
          of it bewildered and engulphed:<br /> Then given it greeting as it rose
          once more<br /> In strength, reflecting from its placid breast<br /> The
          works of man and face of human life;<br /> And lastly, from its
          progress have we drawn<br /> Faith in life endless, the sustaining
          thought<br /> Of human Being, Eternity, and God.<br /> <br /> Imagination
          having been our theme,<br /> So also hath that intellectual Love,<br />
          For they are each in each, and cannot stand<br /> Dividually.&mdash;Here
          must thou be, O Man!<br /> Power to thyself; no Helper hast thou here;<br />
          Here keepest thou in singleness thy state:<br /> No other can divide
          with thee this work:<br /> No secondary hand can intervene<br /> To
          fashion this ability; 'tis thine,<br /> The prime and vital principle
          is thine<br /> In the recesses of thy nature, far<br /> From any reach
          of outward fellowship,<br /> Else is not thine at all. But joy to him,<br />
          Oh, joy to him who here hath sown, hath laid<br /> Here, the foundation
          of his future years!<br /> For all that friendship, all that love can
          do,<br /> All that a darling countenance can look<br /> Or dear voice
          utter, to complete the man,<br /> Perfect him, made imperfect in
          himself,<br /> All shall be his: and he whose soul hath risen<br /> Up
          to the height of feeling intellect<br /> Shall want no humbler
          tenderness; his heart<br /> Be tender as a nursing mother's heart;<br />
          Of female softness shall his life be full,<br /> Of humble cares and
          delicate desires,<br /> Mild interests and gentlest sympathies.<br />
          <br /> Child of my parents! Sister of my soul!<br /> Thanks in sincerest
          verse have been elsewhere<br /> Poured out for all the early tenderness<br />
          Which I from thee imbibed: and 'tis most true<br /> That later seasons
          owed to thee no less;<br /> For, spite of thy sweet influence and the
          touch<br /> Of kindred hands that opened out the springs<br /> Of genial
          thought in childhood, and in spite<br /> Of all that unassisted I had
          marked<br /> In life or nature of those charms minute<br /> That win
          their way into the heart by stealth<br /> (Still to the very going-out
          of youth),<br /> I too exclusively esteemed <i>that</i> love,<br /> And
          sought <i>that</i> beauty, which, as Milton sings,<br /> Hath terror in
          it. Thou didst soften down<br /> This over-sternness; but for thee,
          dear Friend!<br /> My soul, too reckless of mild grace, had stood<br />
          In her original self too confident,<br /> Retained too long a
          countenance severe;<br /> A rock with torrents roaring, with the clouds<br />
          Familiar, and a favourite of the stars:<br /> But thou didst plant its
          crevices with flowers,<br /> Hang it with shrubs that twinkle in the
          breeze,<br /> And teach the little birds to build their nests<br /> And
          warble in its chambers. At a time<br /> When Nature, destined to remain
          so long<br /> Foremost in my affections, had fallen back<br /> Into a
          second place, pleased to become<br /> A handmaid to a nobler than
          herself,<br /> When every day brought with it some new sense<br /> Of
          exquisite regard for common things,<br /> And all the earth was budding
          with these gifts<br /> Of more refined humanity, thy breath,<br /> Dear
          Sister! was a kind of gentler spring<br /> That went before my steps.
          Thereafter came<br /> One whom with thee friendship had early paired;<br />
          She came, no more a phantom to adorn<br /> A moment, but an inmate of
          the heart,<br /> And yet a spirit, there for me enshrined<br /> To
          penetrate the lofty and the low;<br /> Even as one essence of pervading
          light<br /> Shines, in the brightest of ten thousand stars,<br /> And
          the meek worm that feeds her lonely lamp<br /> Couched in the dewy
          grass.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such a theme,<br /> Coleridge! with this my
          argument, of thee<br /> Shall I be silent? O capacious Soul!<br />
          Placed on this earth to love and understand,<br /> And from thy
          presence shed the light of love,<br /> Shall I be mute, ere thou be
          spoken of?<br /> Thy kindred influence to my heart of hearts<br /> Did
          also find its way. Thus fear relaxed<br /> Her over-weening grasp; thus
          thoughts and things<br /> In the self-haunting spirit learned to take<br />
          More rational proportions; mystery,<br /> The incumbent mystery of
          sense and soul,<br /> Of life and death, time and eternity,<br />
          Admitted more habitually a mild<br /> Interposition&mdash;a serene
          delight<br /> In closelier gathering cares, such as become<br /> A human
          creature, howsoe'er endowed,<br /> Poet, or destined for a humbler
          name;<br /> And so the deep enthusiastic joy,<br /> The rapture of the
          hallelujah sent<br /> From all that breathes and is, was chastened,
          stemmed<br /> And balanced by pathetic truth, by trust<br /> In hopeful
          reason, leaning on the stay<br /> Of Providence; and in reverence for
          duty,<br /> Here, if need be, struggling with storms, and there<br />
          Strewing in peace life's humblest ground with herbs,<br /> At every
          season green, sweet at all hours.<br /> <br /> And now, O Friend! this
          history is brought<br /> To its appointed close: the discipline<br />
          And consummation of a Poet's mind,<br /> In everything that stood most
          prominent,<br /> Have faithfully been pictured; we have reached<br />
          The time (our guiding object from the first)<br /> When we may, not
          presumptuously, I hope,<br /> Suppose my powers so far confirmed, and
          such<br /> My knowledge, as to make me capable<br /> Of building up a
          Work that shall endure.<br /> Yet much hath been omitted, as need was;<br />
          Of books how much! and even of the other wealth<br /> That is collected
          among woods and fields,<br /> Far more: for Nature's secondary grace<br />
          Hath hitherto been barely touched upon,<br /> The charm more
          superficial that attends<br /> Her works, as they present to Fancy's
          choice<br /> Apt illustrations of the moral world,<br /> Caught at a
          glance, or traced with curious pains.<br /> <br /> Finally, and above
          all, O Friend! (I speak<br /> With due regret) how much is overlooked<br />
          In human nature and her subtle ways,<br /> As studied first in our own
          hearts, and then<br /> In life among the passions of mankind,<br />
          Varying their composition and their hue,<br /> Where'er we move, under
          the diverse shapes<br /> That individual character presents<br /> To an
          attentive eye. For progress meet,<br /> Along this intricate and
          difficult path,<br /> Whate'er was wanting, something had I gained,<br />
          As one of many schoolfellows compelled,<br /> In hardy independence, to
          stand up<br /> Amid conflicting interests, and the shock<br /> Of
          various tempers; to endure and note<br /> What was not understood,
          though known to be;<br /> Among the mysteries of love and hate,<br />
          Honour and shame, looking to right and left,<br /> Unchecked by
          innocence too delicate,<br /> And moral notions too intolerant,<br />
          Sympathies too contracted. Hence, when called<br /> To take a station
          among men, the step<br /> Was easier, the transition more secure,<br />
          More profitable also; for, the mind<br /> Learns from such timely
          exercise to keep<br /> In wholesome separation the two natures,<br />
          The one that feels, the other that observes.<br /> <br /> Yet one word
          more of personal concern&mdash;<br /> Since I withdrew unwillingly from
          France,<br /> I led an undomestic wanderer's life,<br /> In London
          chiefly harboured, whence I roamed,<br /> Tarrying at will in many a
          pleasant spot<br /> Of rural England's cultivated vales<br /> Or
          Cambrian solitudes. A youth&mdash;(he bore<br /> The name of Calvert&mdash;it
          shall live, if words<br /> Of mine can give it life,) in firm belief<br />
          That by endowments not from me withheld<br /> Good might be furthered&mdash;in
          his last decay<br /> By a bequest sufficient for my needs<br /> Enabled
          me to pause for choice, and walk<br /> At large and unrestrained, nor
          damped too soon<br /> By mortal cares. Himself no Poet, yet<br /> Far
          less a common follower of the world,<br /> He deemed that my pursuits
          and labours lay<br /> Apart from all that leads to wealth, or even<br />
          A necessary maintenance insures,<br /> Without some hazard to the finer
          sense;<br /> He cleared a passage for me, and the stream<br /> Flowed in
          the bent of Nature.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having now<br /> Told what best merits mention,
          further pains<br /> Our present purpose seems not to require,<br /> And
          I have other tasks. Recall to mind<br /> The mood in which this labour
          was begun,<br /> O Friend! The termination of my course<br /> Is nearer
          now, much nearer; yet even then,<br /> In that distraction and intense
          desire,<br /> I said unto the life which I had lived,<br /> Where art
          thou? Hear I not a voice from thee<br /> Which 'tis reproach to hear?
          Anon I rose<br /> As if on wings, and saw beneath me stretched<br />
          Vast prospect of the world which I had been<br /> And was; and hence
          this Song, which like a lark<br /> I have protracted, in the unwearied
          heavens<br /> Singing, and often with more plaintive voice<br /> To
          earth attempered and her deep-drawn sighs,<br /> Yet centring all in
          love, and in the end<br /> All gratulant, if rightly understood.<br />
          <br /> Whether to me shall be allotted life,<br /> And, with life, power
          to accomplish aught of worth,<br /> That will be deemed no insufficient
          plea<br /> For having given the story of myself,<br /> Is all uncertain:
          but, beloved Friend!<br /> When, looking back, thou seest, in clearer
          view<br /> Than any liveliest sight of yesterday,<br /> That summer,
          under whose indulgent skies,<br /> Upon smooth Quantock's airy ridge we
          roved<br /> Unchecked, or loitered 'mid her sylvan combs,<br /> Thou in
          bewitching words, with happy heart,<br /> Didst chaunt the vision of
          that Ancient Man,<br /> The bright-eyed Mariner, and rueful woes<br />
          Didst utter of the Lady Christabel;<br /> And I, associate with such
          labour, steeped<br /> In soft forgetfulness the livelong hours,<br />
          Murmuring of him who, joyous hap, was found,<br /> After the perils of
          his moonlight ride,<br /> Near the loud waterfall; or her who sate<br />
          In misery near the miserable Thorn;<br /> When thou dost to that summer
          turn thy thoughts,<br /> And hast before thee all which then we were,<br />
          To thee, in memory of that happiness,<br /> It will be known, by thee
          at least, my Friend!<br /> Felt, that the history of a Poet's mind<br />
          Is labour not unworthy of regard:<br /> To thee the work shall justify
          itself.<br /> <br /> The last and later portions of this gift<br /> Have
          been prepared, not with the buoyant spirits<br /> That were our daily
          portion when we first<br /> Together wantoned in wild Poesy,<br /> But,
          under pressure of a private grief,<br /> Keen and enduring, which the
          mind and heart,<br /> That in this meditative history<br /> Have been
          laid open, needs must make me feel<br /> More deeply, yet enable me to
          bear<br /> More firmly; and a comfort now hath risen<br /> From hope
          that thou art near, and wilt be soon<br /> Restored to us in renovated
          health;<br /> When, after the first mingling of our tears,<br /> 'Mong
          other consolations, we may draw<br /> Some pleasure from this offering
          of my love.<br /> <br /> Oh! yet a few short years of useful life,<br />
          And all will be complete, thy race be run,<br /> Thy monument of glory
          will be raised;<br /> Then, though (too weak to tread the ways of
          truth)<br /> This age fall back to old idolatry,<br /> Though men return
          to servitude as fast<br /> As the tide ebbs, to ignominy and shame<br />
          By nations sink together, we shall still<br /> Find solace&mdash;knowing
          what we have learnt to know,<br /> Rich in true happiness if allowed to
          be<br /> Faithful alike in forwarding a day<br /> Of firmer trust, joint
          labourers in the work<br /> (Should Providence such grace to us
          vouchsafe)<br /> Of their deliverance, surely yet to come.<br />
          Prophets of Nature, we to them will speak<br /> A lasting inspiration,
          sanctified<br /> By reason, blest by faith: what we have loved,<br />
          Others will love, and we will teach them how;<br /> Instruct them how
          the mind of man becomes<br /> A thousand times more beautiful than the
          earth<br /> On which he dwells, above this frame of things<br /> (Which,
          'mid all revolution in the hopes<br /> And fears of men, doth still
          remain unchanged)<br /> In beauty exalted, as it is itself<br /> Of
          quality and fabric more divine.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a href="#Ctoc">Contents&mdash;<i>The

      <a href="#section25a">The Poem</a><br /><br /> <span style="color: #663300;">Translations
      from Michael Angelo, done at the request of Mr. Duppa, whose acquaintance
      I made through Mr. Southey. Mr. Duppa was engaged in writing the life of
      Michael Angelo, and applied to Mr. Southey and myself to furnish some
      specimens of his poetic genius.&mdash;I. F.</span><br /> <br /> <span
      style="color: #555555;">Compare the two sonnets entitled 'At Florence&mdash;from
      Michael Angelo', in the "Memorials of a Tour in Italy" in 1837.<br /> <br />
      The following extract from a letter of Wordsworth's to Sir George
      Beaumont, dated October 17, 1805, will cast light on the next three
      sonnets. </span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I mentioned Michael Angelo's poetry some time ago; it is the most
        difficult to construe I ever met with, but just what you would expect
        from such a man, shewing abundantly how conversant his soul was with
        great things. There is a mistake in the world concerning the Italian
        language; the poetry of Dante and Michael Angelo proves, that if there
        be little majesty and strength in Italian verse, the fault is in the
        authors, and not in the tongue. I can translate, and have translated two
        books of Ariosto, at the rate, nearly, of one hundred lines a day; but
        so much meaning has been put by Michael Angelo into so little room, and
        that meaning sometimes so excellent in itself, that I found the
        difficulty of translating him insurmountable. I attempted, at least,
        fifteen of the sonnets, but could not anywhere succeed. I have sent you
        the only one I was able to finish; it is far from being the best, or
        most characteristic, but the others were too much for me."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">The last of the three sonnets probably
      belongs to the year 1804, as it is quoted in a letter to Sir George
      Beaumont, dated Grasmere, August 6. The year is not given, but I think it
      must have been 1804, as he says that "within the last month," he had
      written, "700 additional lines" of <i>The Prelude</i>; and that poem was
      finished in May 1805.<br /> <br /> The titles given to them make it
      necessary to place these Sonnets in the order which follows.<br /> <br />

          Yes! hope may with my strong desire keep pace,<br /> And I be
          undeluded, unbetrayed;<br /> For if of our affections none finds grace<br />
          In sight of Heaven, then, wherefore hath God made<br /> The world which
          we inhabit? Better plea<br /> Love cannot have, than that in loving
          thee<br /> Glory to that eternal Peace is paid,<br /> Who such divinity
          to thee imparts<br /> As hallows and makes pure all gentle hearts.<br />
          His hope is treacherous only whose love dies<br /> With beauty, which
          is varying every hour;<br /> But, in chaste hearts uninfluenced by the
          power<br /> Of outward change, there blooms a deathless flower,<br />

      translated, is not wholly by Michael Angelo, the sculptor and painter, but
      is taken from patched-up versions of his poem by his nephew of the same
      name. Michael Angelo only wrote the first eight lines, and these have been
      garbled in his nephew's edition. The original lines are thus given by
      Guasti in his edition of Michael Angelo's <i>Poems</i> (1863) restored to
      their true reading, from the autograph MSS. in Rome and Florence.</span><br />

      The Hawkshead Beck

      <br /> <span style="color: #555555;">(See pp. 188-89, <a href="#Wordsworth3"><i>The
      Prelude</i></a>, <a href="#24b4">book iv</a>.)<br /> <br /> Mr. Rawnsley,
      formerly of Wray Vicarage&mdash;now Canon Rawnsley of Crosthwaite
      Vicarage, Keswick&mdash;sent me the following letter in reference to:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        ... that unruly child of mountain birth,<br /> The famous brook, who,
        soon as he was boxed<br /> Within our garden, found himself at once,<br />
        As if by trick insidious and unkind,<br /> Stripped of his voice and left
        to dimple down<br /> ...<br /> I looked at him and smiled, and smiled
        again,<br /> ... <br /> 'Ha,' quoth I, 'pretty prisoner, are you there!'
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I was not quite content with Dr. Cradock's identification of this
        brook, or of the garden; partly because, beyond the present garden
        square I found, on going up the brook, other garden squares, which were
        much more likely to have been the garden belonging to Anne Tyson's
        cottage, and because in these garden plots the stream was not 'stripped
        of his voice,' by the covering of Coniston flags, as is the case lower
        down towards the market place; and partly because&mdash;as you notice&mdash;you
        can both hear and see the stream through the interstices of the flags,
        and that it can hardly be described (by one who will listen) as stripped
        of its voice.<br /> <br /> At the same time I was bound to admit that in
        comparing the voice of the stream here in the 'channel paved by man's
        officious care' with the sound of it up in the fields beyond the
        vicarage, nearer its birth-place, it certainly might be said to be
        softer voiced; and as the poet speaks of it as 'that unruly child of
        mountain birth,' it looks as if he too had realised the difference.<br />
        <br /> But whilst I thought that the identification of Dr. Cradock and
        yourself was very happy (in absence of other possibilities), I had not
        thought that Wordsworth would describe the stream as 'dimpling down,' or
        address it as a 'pretty prisoner.' A smaller stream seemed necessary.<br />
        <br /> It was, therefore, not a little curious that, in poking about
        among the garden plots on the west bank of the stream, fronting (as
        nearly as I could judge) Anne Tyson's cottage, to seek for remains of
        the ash tree, in which so often the poet&mdash;as he lay awake on summer
        nights&mdash;had watched 'the moon in splendour couched among the
        leaves,' rocking 'with every impulse of the breeze,' I not only stumbled
        upon the remains of an ash tree&mdash; now a 'pollard'&mdash;which is
        evidently sprung from a larger tree since decayed (and which for all I
        know may be one of the actual parts of the ancient tree itself); but
        also had the good luck to fall into conversation with a certain Isaac
        Hodgson, who volunteered the following information.<br /> <br /> First,
        that Wordsworth, it was commonly said, had lodged part of his time with
        one Betty Braithwaite, in the very house called Church Hill House.<br />
        <br /> She was a widow, and kept a confectionery shop, and 'did a deal of
        baking,' he believed.<br /> <br /> Secondly, that there was a little patch
        of garden at the back of the house, with a famous spring well&mdash;still
        called Old Betty's Well&mdash;in it, and that only a few paces from
        where I was then standing by the pollard ash.<br /> <br /> On jumping over
        the fence I found myself on the western side of the quaint old Church
        Hill House, with magnificent views of the whole of the western side of
        Hawkshead Vale; grassy swell and wooded rises taking the eye up to the
        moorland ridge between us and Coniston.<br /> <br /> 'But,' said I, 'what
        about Betty's Well.' 'Oh,' said my friend, 'that's a noted spring, that
        never freezes, and always runs; we all drink of it, and neighbours send
        to it. Here it is,' he continued; and, gazing down, I saw a little
        dripping well of water, lustrous, clear, coming evidently in continuous
        force from the springs or secret channels up hill, pausing for a moment
        at the trough, thence falling into a box or 'channel paved by man's
        officious care,' and in a moment out of sight and soundless, to pursue
        its way, 'stripped of its voice,' towards the main Town beck, that ran
        at the north-east border of the garden plot. 'Ha, pretty prisoner,' and
        the words 'dimple down' came to my mind at once as appropriate. 'Old
        Betty's Well gave the key-note of the 'famous brook'; and 'boxed within
        our garden' seemed an appropriate and exact description.<br /> <br />

      <p>
        was there none. Not so, however, the Ash tree, the remains of which I
        have spoken of. From the bedroom of Betty Braithwaite's house the boy
        could have watched the moon,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'while to and fro<br /> In the dark summit of the waving tree<br /> She
          rocked with every impulse of the breeze.'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        'In old times,' said my friend, 'the wall fence ran across the garden,
        just beyond this spring well, so you see it was but a small spot, was
        this garden close.' Yes; but the

        were known the better, and loved the more on that account. Certainly,
        thought I to myself, here is the famous spring; a brook that Wordsworth
        must have known, and that may have been the centre of memory to him in
        his description of those early Hawkshead days, with its metaphor of
        fountain life.<br /> <br /> May we not, as we gaze on this little fountain
        well, in a garden plot at the back of one of the grey huts of this 'one
        dear vale,' point as with a wand, and say,

      letter of Mr. Rawnsley's (Christmas, 1882) casts light, both on the
      Hawkshead beck and fountain, and on the stone seat in the market square,
      referred to in the <a href="#24b4">fourth book</a> of <a href=""><i>The
      Prelude</i></a>.</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Postlethwaite of the Sun Inn at Hawkshead, has a father aged 82, who
        can remember that there was a <i>stone</i> bench, not called old
        Betty's, but Old Jane's Stone, on which she used to spread nuts and
        cakes for the scholars of the Grammar School, but that it did not stand
        where the Market Hall now is, and no one ever remembers a stone or
        stone-bench standing there. This stone or stone-bench stood about
        opposite the Red Lion inn, in front of the little row of houses that run
        east and west, just as you pass out of the village in a northerly
        direction by the Red Lion. This stone or stone-bench is not associated
        with dark pine trees, but they may have passed away root and branch in
        an earlier generation.<br /> <br /> Next and most interesting, I think, as
        showing that I was right in the matter of the <i>famous fountain,</i> or
        spring in the garden, behind Betty Braithwaite's house. There exists in
        Hawkshead near this house a covered-in place or shed, to which all the
        village repair for their drinking-water, and always have done so. It is
        known by the name of the Spout House, and the water&mdash;which flows
        all the year from a longish spout, with an overflow one by its side&mdash;comes
        direct from the little drop well in Betty B.'s garden, after having its
        voice stripped and boxed therein; and, falling out of the spout into a
        deep stone basin and culvert, runs through the town to join the Town
        Beck.<br /> <br /> So wedded are the Hawkshead folk to this, their
        familiar fountainhead, that though water is supplied in stand-pipes now
        from a Reservoir, the folks won't have it, and come here to this
        spout-house, bucket and jug in hand, morn, noon and night. I have never
        seen anything so like a continental scene at the gathering at Hawkshead
        spout-house.<br /> <br /> Lastly, there is a very aged thorn-tree in the
        churchyard&mdash;blown over but propped up&mdash;in which the
        forefathers of the hamlet used to sit as boys (in the thorn, that is,
        not the churchyard), and which has been worn smooth by many Hawkshead
        generations. The tradition is, that <i>Wordsworth used to sit a deal in
        it when at school.</i>"

      The Hawkshead Morning Walk: Summer Vacation
    </h4>
    <p>
      <br /> <span style="color: #555555;">(See p. 197, <a href=""><i>The Prelude</i></a>,
      <a href="#24b4">book iv.</a> ll. 323-38)</span><br /> <br /> <br /> <span
      style="color: #555555;">If the farm-house where Wordsworth spent the
      evening before this memorable morning walk was either at Elterwater or
      High Arnside, and the homeward pathway led across the ridge of Ironkeld,
      either by the old mountain road (now almost disused), or over the pathless
      fells, there are two points from either of which the sea might be seen in
      the distance. The one is from the heights looking down to the Duddon
      estuary, across the Coniston valley; the other is from a spot nearer
      Hawkshead, where Morecambe Bay is visible. In the former case "the meadows
      and the lower grounds" would be those in Yewdale; in the latter case, they
      would be those between Latterbarrow and Hawkshead; and, on either
      alternative, the "solid mountains" would be those of the Coniston group&mdash;the
      Old Man and Wetherlam. It is also possible that the course of the walk was
      over the Latterbarrow fells, or heights of Colthouse; but, from the
      reference to the sunrise "not unseen" from the copse and field, through
      which the "homeward pathway wound," it may be supposed that the course was
      south-east, and therefore not over these fells, when his back would have
      been to the sun. Dr. Cradock's <a href="#24b4T">note</a> to the text (p.
      197) sums up all that can "be safely said"; but Mr. Rawnsley has supplied
      me with the following interesting remarks:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "After a careful reading of the passage describing the poet's return
        from a festal night, spent in some farm-house beyond the hills, I am
        quite unable to say that the path from High Arnside over the Ironkeld
        range entirely suits the description. Is it not possible that the lad
        had school-fellows whose parents lived in Yewdale? If he had, and was
        returning from the party in one of the Yewdale farms, he would, as he
        ascended towards Tarn Howes, and faced about south, to gain the main
        Coniston road, by traversing the meadows between Berwick ground and the
        top of the Hawkshead and Coniston Hill, command a view of the sea that
        <i>lay laughing at a distance</i>; and <i>near, the solid mountains</i>&mdash;Wetherlam
        and Coniston Old Man&mdash;would shine <i>bright as the clouds.</i> I
        think this is likely to have been the poet's track, because he speaks of
        labourers going forth to till the fields; and the Yewdale valley is one
        that is (at its head) chiefly arable, so that he would be likelier to
        have gazed on them there than in the vale of Hawkshead itself. One is
        here, however&mdash;as in a former passage, when we fixed on Yewdale as
        the one described as being a <i>cultured vale</i>&mdash;obliged to
        remember that in Wordsworth's boyhood wheat was grown more extensively
        than is now the case in these parts. Of course, the Furness Fell, above
        Colthouse, might have been the scene. It is eminently suited to the
        description."

        "We reached Cambridge at half-past nine. In our way to the Inn we
        stopped at the gate of St. John's College to set down one of our
        passengers. The stopping of the carriage roused me from a sleepy musing,
        and I was awe-stricken with the solemnity of the old gateway, and the
        light from a great distance within streaming along the pavement. When
        they told me it was the entrance to <i>St. John's</i> College, I was
        still more affected by the gloomy yet beautiful sight before me, for I
        thought of my dearest brother in his youthful days passing through that
        gateway to his home, and I could have believed that I saw him there even
        then, as I had seen him in the first year of his residence. I met with
        Mr. Clarkson at the Inn, and was, you may believe, rejoiced to hear his
        voice at the coach door. We supped together, and immediately after
        supper I went to bed, and slept well, and at 8 o'clock next morning went
        to Trinity Chapel. There I stood for many minutes in silence before the
        statue of Newton, while the organ sounded. I never saw a statue that
        gave me one hundredth part so much pleasure&mdash;but pleasure, that is
        not the word, it is a sublime sensation&mdash;in harmony with sentiments
        of devotion to the Divine Being, and reverence for the holy places where
        He is worshipped. We walked in the groves all the morning and visited
        the Colleges. I sought out a favourite ash tree which my brother speaks
        of in his poem on his own life&mdash;a tree covered with ivy. We dined
        with a fellow of Peter-House in his rooms, and after dinner I went to
        King's College Chapel. There, and everywhere else at Cambridge, I was
        even much more impressed with the effect of the buildings than I had
        been formerly, and I do believe that this power of receiving an enlarged
        enjoyment from the sight of buildings is one of the privileges of our
        later years. I have this moment received a letter from William...."

    <h4>
      The Meeting-Point of Two Highways
    </h4>
    <p>
      <br /> <span style="color: #555555;">(See p. 353, <a href=""><i>The Prelude</i></a>,
      <a href="#24b12">book xii.</a> l. 293)</span><br /> <br /> <br /> <span
      style="color: #555555;">The following extract from a letter of Mr.
      Rawnsley's casts important light on a difficult question of localization.
      Dr. Cradock is inclined now to select the Outgate Crag, the second of the
      four places referred to by Mr. Rawnsley. But the first may have been the
      place, and the extract which follows will show how much is yet to be done
      in this matter of localizing poetical allusions.</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "As to
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'the crag,<br /> That, from the meeting-point of two highways<br />
          Ascending, overlooked them both, far stretched,'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        there seems to be no doubt but that we have four competitors for the
        honour of being the place to which the poet:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'impatient for the sight<br /> Of those led palfreys that should bear
          them home'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        repaired with his brothers
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'one Christmas-time,<br /> On the glad eve of its dear holidays.'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        And unless, as it seems is quite possible, from what one sees in other
        of Wordsworth's poems, he really stood on one of the crags, and then in
        his description drew the picture of the landscape at his feet from his
        memory of what it was as seen from another of the vantage places, we
        need a high crag, rising gradually or abruptly from the actual
        meeting-place of two highways, with, if possible at this distance of
        time, a wall&mdash;or traces of it&mdash;quite at its summit. (I may
        mention that the wallers in this country still give two hundred years as
        the length of time that a dry wall will stand.) We need also traces of
        an old thorn tree close by. The wall, too, must be so placed on the
        summit of the crag that, as it faces the direction in which the lad is
        looking for his palfrey, it shall afford shelter to him against
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'the sleety rain,<br /> And all the business of the elements.'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        It is evident that the lad would be looking out in a north-easterly
        direction,<i> i. e.</i> towards the head of Windermere and Ambleside. So
        that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'the mist,<br /> That on the line of each of those two roads<br />
          Advanced in such indisputable shapes,'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        was urged by a wind that found the poet at his look-out station, glad to
        have the wall between him and it. Further, there must be in close
        proximity wood and the sound of rushing water, or the lapping of a lake
        wind-driven against the marge, for the boy remembers that 'the bleak
        music from that old stone wall' was mingled with <i>the noise of wood
        and water.</i> The roads spoken of must be two highways, and must be
        capable of being seen for some distance; unless, as it is just possible,
        the epithet <i>far-stretched</i> may be taken as applying not so much to
        the roads, as to the gradual ascent of the crag from the meeting-place
        of the two highways.<br /> <br /> The scene from the crag must be
        extended, and half plain half wood-land; at least one gathers as much
        from the lines:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'as the mist<br /> Gave intermitting prospect of the copse<br /> And
          plain beneath.'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Lastly, it was a day of driving sleet and mist, and this of itself would
        necessitate that the poet and his brothers should only go to the place
        close to which the ponies must pass, or from which most plainly the
        roads were visible.<br /> <br /> The boys too were
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'feverish, and tired, and restless,'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        and a schoolboy, to gain his point on such a day and on such an errand,
        does not take much account of a mile of country to be travelled over.<br />
        <br /> So that it is immaterial, I think, to make the distance from
        Hawkshead of either of the four crags or vantage grounds a factor in
        decision.<br /> <br /> The farther the lads were from home when they met
        their ponies, the longer ride back they would have, and this to
        schoolboys is matter of consideration at such times.<br /> <br /> Taking
        then a survey of the ground of choice, we have to decide whether the
        crag in question is situated at the first division or main split of the
        road from Ambleside furthest from Hawkshead, or whether at the place
        where the two roads converge again into one nearer Hawkshead.<br /> <br />
        Whether, that is, the crag above the Pullwyke quarry, at the junction of
        the road to Water Barngates and the road to Wray and Outgate is to be
        selected, about two miles from Hawkshead; or whether we are to fix on
        the spot you have chosen, at the point about a mile north-east of
        Hawkshead, <i>called in the ordnance map Outgate.</i><br /> <br /> Of the
        two I incline to the former, for these reasons. The boys could not be so
        certain of <i>not missing the ponies</i>, at any other place than here
        at Pullwyke.<br /> <br /> The crag exactly answers the poet's description,
        a rising ground, the meeting-place of two highways. For in the poet's
        time the old Hawkshead and Outgate road at the Pullwyke corner ran at
        the very foot of the rising ground (roughly speaking) parallel to and
        some 60 to 100 yards west of the present road from the Pull to Wray.<br />
        <br /> It is true that no trace of wall is visible at its summit, but the
        summit has been planted since with trees, and walls are often removed at
        time of planting.<br /> <br /> The poet would have a full view of the main
        road, down to, and round, the Pullwyke Bay; he would see the branch road
        from the fork, as it mounted the Water Barngates Hill, to the west, and
        would see the other road of the fork far-stretched and going south.<br />
        <br /> He would also have an extended view of copse and meadow land. He
        might, if the wind were south-easterly, hear the noise of Windermere,
        sobbing in the Pullwyke Bay, and would without doubt hear also the roar
        of the Pull Beck water, as it passed down from the Ironkeld slopes on
        his left towards the lake.<br /> <br /> It might be objected that the poem
        gives us the idea of a crag which, from the Hawkshead side at any rate,
        would require to be of more difficult ascent than this is, to justify
        the idea of difficulty as suggested in the lines:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'thither I repaired,<br /> Scout-like, and gained the summit;'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        but I do not think we need read more into the lines than that the boy
        felt&mdash;as he scanned the country with his eyes, on the <i>qui vive</i>
        at every rise in the ground&mdash;the feelings of a scout, who questions
        constantly the distant prospect.<br /> <br /> And certainly the Pullwyke
        quarry crag rises most steeply from the meeting-point of the two
        highways.<br /> <br /> Next as to the Outgate crag, which you have chosen.
        I am out of love with it. First, if the lads wanted to make sure of the
        ponies, they would not have ascended it, but would have stayed just at
        the Hawkshead side of Outgate, or at the village itself, at the point of
        convergence of the ways.<br /> <br /> Secondly, the crag can hardly be
        described as rising from the meeting-point of two highways; only one
        highway passes near it.<br /> <br /> The crag is of so curious a formation
        geologically, that I can't fancy the poet describing his memory of it,
        without calling it a terraced hill, or an ascent by natural terraces.<br />
        <br /> Then, again, the prospect is not sufficiently extended from it.
        The stream not near enough, or rather not of size enough, to be heard.
        Blelham Tarn is not too far to have added to the watery sound, it is
        true, but the wind we suppose to have been north-east, and the sound of
        the Blelham Tarn would be much carried away from him.<br /> <br /> The
        present stone wall is not near the summit, and is of comparatively
        recent date. It is difficult to believe from the slope of the outcrop of
        rock that a wall could ever have been at the summit.<br /> <br /> But
        there are two other vantage grounds intermediate between those extremes,
        both of which were probably in the mind and memory of the poet as he
        described the scene, and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'The intermitting prospect of the copse.<br /> And plain beneath,'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        allowed him by the mist. One of these is the High Crag, about
        three-quarters of a mile from the divergence or convergence of the two
        highways, which Dr. Cradock has selected.<br /> <br /> There can be no
        doubt that this is the crag <i>par excellence</i> for a wide and
        extended look-out over all the country between Outgate and Ambleside.
        Close at its summit there remain aged thorn trees, but no trace of a
        wall.<br /> <br /> But High Crag can hardly be said to have risen at <i>the
        meeting-point of two highways,</i> unless we are to understand the
        epithet 'far-stretched' as applying to the south-western slopes or
        skirts of the hill; and the two highways, the roads between Water
        Barngates on the west, and the bridle road between Pullwyke and Outgate
        at their Outgate junction, and this is rather too far a stretch.<br />
        <br /> It is quite true that if bridle paths can be described as
        highways, there may be said to be a meeting-point of these close at the
        north-eastern side of the crag.<br /> <br /> But, remembering that the
        ponies came from Penrith, the driver was not likely to have had any
        intimate knowledge of these bridle paths; while, at the same time, on
        that misty day, I much question whether the boys on the look-out at High
        Crag could have seen ponies creeping along between walled roads at so
        great a distance as half a mile or more.<br /> <br /> And this would seem
        to have been the problem for them on that day.<br /> <br /> I ought in
        fairness to say that it is not likely that the roads were then (as
        to-day) walled up high on either side. To-day, even from the summit of
        High Crag, only the head and ears of a pony could be seen as it passed
        up the Water Barngates Road; but at the end of last century many of the
        roads were only partially walled off from the moorlands they passed over
        in the Lake Country.<br /> <br /> Still, as I said, High Crag was a point
        of vantage that the poet, as a lad, must have often climbed, in this
        part of the country, if he wanted to indulge in the delights of
        panoramic scene.<br /> <br /> There is a wall some hundred yards from the
        summit, on the south-westerly flank of High Crag; near this&mdash;at a
        point close by, two large holly trees&mdash;the boy might have sheltered
        himself against the north-eastern wind, and have got a closer and better
        view of the road between Barngates and Outgate, and Randy Pike and
        Outgate.<br /> <br /> Here, too, he could possibly hear the sound of the
        stream in the dingle or woody hollow immediately at his feet; but I am
        far from content with this as being the spot the poet watched from.<br />
        <br /> There is again a fourth possible look-out place, to which you will
        remember I directed your attention, nearer Randy Pike. The slope,
        covered with larches, rises up from the Randy Pike Road to a precipitous
        crag which faces north and east.<br /> <br /> From this, a grand view of
        the country between Randy Pike and Pullwyke is obtained, and if the
        bridle paths might&mdash;as is possible, but unlikely&mdash;be called
        two highways, then this crag could be spoken of as rising from the
        meeting place of the two highways. For the old Hawkshead Road passed
        along to the east, within calling distance (say ninety yards), and a
        bridle road from Pullwyke, now used chiefly by the quarrymen, passed
        within eighty yards to the west; while it is certain that the brook
        below, when swollen by winter rains, might be loud enough to be heard
        from the copse. This crag is known as Coldwell or Caudwell Crag, and is
        situated about half a mile east-south-east of the High Crag.<br /> <br />
        It has this much in its favour, that a wall of considerable age crests
        its summit, and one can whilst sitting down on a rock close behind it be
        sheltered from the north and east, and yet obtain an extensive view of
        the subadjacent country. <b>If</b> it were certain that the ponies when
        they got to Pullwyke did not go up towards Water Barngates, and so to
        Hawkshead, then there is no crag in the district which would so
        thoroughly answer to all the needs of the boys, and to all the points of
        description the poet has placed on record.<br /> <br /> But it is just
        this <b>if</b> that makes me decide on the Pullwyke Crag&mdash;the one
        first described&mdash;as being the actual spot to which, scout-like, the
        schoolboys clomb, on that eventful <i>eve of their dear holidays;</i>
        while, at the same time, it is my firm conviction that Wordsworth&mdash;as
        he painted the memories of that event&mdash;had also before his mind's
        eye the scene as viewed from Coldwell and High Crag."

      Dunmow, Essex, in January, 1807. The variations, both in the title and in
      the text, from that which Coleridge finally adopted (see p. 129), are

          Wherein (high theme by thee first sung aright)<br /> Of the foundations
          and the building up<br /> Of thine own spirit thou hast loved to tell<br />
          What <i>may</i> be told, by words revealable:<br /> With heavenly
          breathings, like the secret soul<br /> Of vernal growth, oft quickening
          in the heart<br /> Thoughts, that obey no mastery of words,<br /> Pure
          Self-beholdings! Theme as hard as high,<br /> Of Smiles spontaneous and
          mysterious Fear!<br /> The first born they of Reason and twin birth!<br />
          Of tides obedient to external force,<br /> And currents
          self-determin'd, as might seem,<br /> Or by some inner power! Of

          that scarce would know itself from Fear;<br /> Sense of past youth, and

          nigh<br /> Where Wisdom's voice has found a list'ning Heart.<br /> Amid
          the howl of more than wintry storms<br /> The Halcyon hears the Voice
          of vernal Hours,<br /> Already on the wing!<br /> <br /> Eve following
          Eve<br /> Dear tranquil Time, when the sweet sense of Home<br /> Is
          sweetest! Moments, for their own sake hail'd,<br /> And more desired,
          more precious for thy Song!<br /> In silence listening, like a devout
          child,<br /> My soul lay passive, by the various strain<br /> Driven as
          in surges now, beneath the stars<br /> With momentary stars of her own
          birth,<br /> Fair constellated Foam, still darting off<br /> Into the
          Darkness; now a tranquil Sea,<br /> Outspread and bright, yet swelling
          to the Moon.<br /> <br /> And when&mdash;O Friend! my Comforter! my
          Guide!<br /> Strong in thyself and powerful to give strength!&mdash;<br />
          Thy long sustained Song finally clos'd,<br /> And thy deep voice had
          ceas'd&mdash;yet thou thyself<br /> Wert still before mine eyes, and
          round us both<br /> That happy Vision of beloved Faces&mdash;<br /> (All
          whom, I deepliest love&mdash;in one room all!)<br /> Scarce conscious
          and yet conscious of its close<br /> I sate, my Being blended in one
          Thought,<br /> (Thought was it? or aspiration? or resolve?)<br />

      General Beaupuy
    </h4>
    <p>
      <span style="color: #555555;">(See pp. 297 and 302, <a href=""><i>The
      Prelude</i></a>, <a href="#24b9">book ix.</a>)</span><br /> <br /> <br />
      <span style="color: #555555;">Professor Emile Legouis of Lyons&mdash;a
      thorough student, and a very competent expounder, of our modern English
      Literature&mdash;supplied me, some years ago, with numerous facts in
      reference to Wordsworth's friend General Beaupuy, and his family, from
      which I extract the following:</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>The Prelude</i> gives us very little precise information about the
        republican officer with whom Wordsworth became acquainted in France, and
        on whom he bestowed more praise than on almost any other of his
        contemporaries. We only gather the following facts:&mdash;That his name
        was <i>Beaupuy</i>, that he was quartered at Orleans, with royalist
        officers, sometime between November 1791 and the spring of 1792, and
        that
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          'He perished fighting, <i>in supreme command</i>,<br /> Upon the
          borders of the unhappy Loire,<br /> For liberty, against deluded men,<br />
          His fellow-countrymen....'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Though it seems very easy to identify a general even with such scanty
        data, the task is rendered more difficult by two inaccuracies in
        Wordsworth's statement, which, however, can be explained and redressed
        without much difficulty.<br /> <br /> The first inaccuracy is in the
        spelling of the name, which is <i>Beaupuy</i> and not <i>Beaupuis</i>&mdash;a
        slight mistake considering that Wordsworth was a foreigner, and,
        besides, wrote down his friend's name ten years and perhaps more after
        losing sight of him. Moreover, the name of the general who, I think, was
        meant by Wordsworth, I have found spelt <i>Beaupuy</i> in one instance,
        viz. the signature of a letter of his, as printed in <i>Vie et
        Correspondance de Merlin de Thionville</i>, publi&eacute;e par Jean
        Reynaud, Paris, 1860 (2'e partie p. 241).<br /> <br /> The spelling of
        proper names was not so fixed then as it is nowadays, and this
        irregularity is not to be wondered at.<br /> <br /> The second inaccuracy
        consists in stating that General Beaupuy died on the banks of the Loire
        during the Vendean war. Indeed, he was grievously wounded at the Battle
        of Ch&acirc;teau-Gonthier, on the 26th of October 1793, and reported as
        dead. His soldiers thought he had been killed, and the rumour must have
        spread abroad, as it was recorded by A. Thiers himself in his <i>Histoire
        de la R&eacute;volution</i>, and by A. Challemel in his <i>Histoire Mus&eacute;e
        de la R&eacute;publique Fran&ccedil;aise</i>.<br /> <br /> It is no wonder
        that Wordsworth, who was then in England, and could only read imperfect
        accounts of what took place in France, should have been mistaken too.<br />
        <br /> No other General Beaupuy is recorded in the history of the
        Revolution, so far as I have been able to ascertain. The moral character
        of the officer, whose life I shall relate, answers to Wordsworth's
        description, and is worthy of his high estimate.<br /> <br /> Armand
        Michel de Bachelier, Chevalier de Beaupuy, was born at Mussidan, in
        Perigord, on the 15th of July 1757. He belonged to a noble family, less
        proud of its antiquity than of the blood it had shed for France on many
        battlefields. On his mother's side (Mlle. de Villars), he reckoned
        Montaigne, the celebrated essayist, among his ancestors. His parents
        having imbibed the philanthropic ideas of the time, educated him
        according to their principles.<br /> <br /> He had four brothers, who were
        all destined to turn republicans and do good service to the new cause,
        though their interest certainly lay in the opposite direction.<br />
        <br /> ...<br /> <br /> He was made sub-lieutenant in the regiment of
        Bassigny (33rd division of foot) on the 2nd of March 1773, and
        lieutenant of grenadiers on the 1st of October of the same year.<br />
        <br /> In 1791 he was first lieutenant in the same regiment. Having sided
        with the Revolution, he was appointed commander of a battalion of
        national volunteers in the department of Dordogne. I have not found the
        exact date of this appointment, but it must have taken place immediately
        after his stay at Orl&eacute;ans with Wordsworth.<br /> <br /> I have
        found no further mention of his name till September 1792, when he is
        known to have served in the "Arm&eacute;e du Rhin," under General
        Custine, and contributed to the taking of Spire.<br /> <br /> He <a
        name="fr35A" id="fr35A">took</a> an important part in the taking of
        Worms, 4th October; of Mayence (Maenz) 21st October. He was among the
        garrison of Mayence when this place was besieged by the Prussians, and
        obliged to capitulate after a long and famous siege (from 6th April 1793
        to 22nd July 1793).<a href="#35A"><sup>A</sup></a><br /> <br /> During the
        siege he wrote a journal of all the operations. Unfortunately, this
        journal is very short, and purely military. It has been handed down to
        us, and is found in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale of Paris in the <i>Papiers
        de Merlin de Thionville</i>, n. acq. fr. Nos. 244-252, 8 vol. in-8&#176;.
        Beaupuy's journal is in the 3rd volume, fol. 213-228.<br /> <br /> ...<br />
        <br /> In the Vendean war, the "Mayen&ccedil;ais," or soldiers returned
        from Mayence, made themselves conspicuous, and bore almost all the brunt
        of the campaign. But none of them distinguished himself more than
        Beaupuy, then a General of Brigade.<br /> <br /> The Mayen&ccedil;ais
        arrived in Vend&eacute;e at the end of August or beginning of September
        1793. To Beaupuy's skill the victory of Chollet (Oct. 17, 1793) is
        attributed by Jomini. In this battle he fought hand to hand with and
        overcame a Vendean cavalier. He himself had three horses killed, and had
        a very narrow escape. On the battlefield he was made <i>general of
        division</i> by the "Repres&eacute;ntants du peuple." It was after
        Chollet that the Vendeans made the memorable crossing of the Loire at
        St. Florent.<br /> <br /> At Laval and Ch&acirc;teau-Gonthier (Oct. 26) a
        terrible defeat was inflicted on the Republicans, owing to the
        incapacity of their commander-in-chief, L&eacute;chelle. The whole corps
        commanded by General Beaupuy was crushed by a terrible fire, He himself,
        after withstanding for two or three hours with 2000 or 3000 men all the
        attacks of the royalists, was disabled by a shot, and fell, crying out,
        "<i>Laissez-moi l&agrave;, et portez &agrave; mes grenadiers ma chemise
        sanglante</i>." His soldiers thought he was dead, and then the error was
        spread, which was repeated by Wordsworth, Thiers, and Challamel.
        Wordsworth's mistake is so far interesting, as it seems to prove that
        very little or no correspondence passed between the two friends after
        they had parted. Beaupuy, moreover, had too much work upon his hands to
        give much of his time to letter-writing.<br /> <br /> Though severely
        wounded, Beaupuy lived on, and less than six weeks after the battle of
        Ch&acirc;teau-Gonthier, he was seen on the ramparts of Angers, where he
        required himself to be carried to animate his soldiers and head the
        defenders of the place, from which the Vendeans were driven after a
        severe contest (Dec. 5 and 6).<br /> <br /> On the 22nd of December 1793
        he shared in the victory of Savenay with his celebrated friends,
        Marceau, Kleber, and Westermann. After this battle, which put an end to
        the great Vendean war, he wrote the following letter to his friend
        Merlin de Thionville, the celebrated "repr&eacute;sentant du peuple."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "<b>Savenay</b>, le 4 Niv&ocirc;se au 2'e (25 Dec. 73).<br /> <br />
          "Enfin, enfin, mon cher Merlin, elle n'est plus cette arm&eacute;e
          royale ou catholique, comme tu voudras! J'en ai vu, avec tes braves
          collegues Prieur et Eurreau, les d&eacute;bris, consistant en 150
          cavaliers battant l'eau dans le marais de Montaire; et comme tu
          connais ma veracit&eacute; tu peux dire avec assurance que les deux
          combats de Savenay ont mis fin &agrave; la guerre de la nouvelle Vend&eacute;e
          et aux chim&eacute;riques esp&eacute;rances des royalists.<br /> <br />
          L'histoire ne vous presente point de combat dont le suites aient
          &eacute;t&eacute; plus d&eacute;cisives. Ah! mon brave, comme tu
          aurais joui! quelle attaque! mais quelle d&eacute;route aussi! Il
          fallait les voir ces soldats de Jesus et de Louis XVII, se jetant dans
          les marais ou oblig&eacute;s de se rendre par 5 ou 600 &agrave; la
          fois; et Langr&eacute;ni&egrave;re pris et les autres generaux dispers&eacute;s
          et aux abois!<br /> <br /> Cette arm&eacute;e, dont tu avais vu les
          restes de la terrasse de St. Florent, &eacute;tait redevenue
          formidable par son recrutement dans les d&eacute;partements envahis.
          Je les ai bien vus, bien examin&eacute;s, j'ai reconnu m&ecirc;me de
          mes figures de Chollet et de Laval, et &agrave; leur contenance et
          &agrave; leur mine, je l'assure qu'il ne leur manquait du soldat que
          l'habit. Des troupes qui ont battu de tels Fran&ccedil;ais peuvent se
          flatter ainsi de vainere des peuples assez l&acirc;aches pour se r&eacute;unir
          centre un seul et encore pour la cause des rois! Enfin, je ne sais si
          je me trompe, mais cette guerre de brigands, de paysans, sur laquelle
          on a jet&eacute; tant de ridicule, que l'on d&eacute;daignait, que
          l'on affectait de regarder comme m&eacute;prisable, m'a toujours paru,
          pour la r&eacute;publique, la grande partie, et il me semble a present
          qu'avec nos autres ennemis, nous ne ferrons plus que peloter.<br />
          <br /> Adieu, brave montagnard, adieu! Actuellement que cette ex&eacute;crable
          guerre est termin&eacute;e, que les m&acirc;nes de nos freres sont
          satisfaits, je vais guerir. J'ai obtenu de tes confreres un cong&eacute;
          qui finira au moment o&ugrave; la guerre recommencera.<br /> <br /> <b>Le
          G&eacute;neral de Brigade Beaupuy</b>.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        I think I can recognize in this letter some traits of Beaupuy's
        character as pointed out by Wordsworth, not excepting the
        half-suppressed criticism:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          '... somewhat vain he was,<br /> Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity,<br />
          But fondness, and a kind of radiant joy<br /> Diffused around him ...'
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Passing over numerous military incidents, on the 26th of June 1796
        Beaupuy received seven or eight sabre-cuts at Jorich-Wildstadt. But on
        the 8th of July he was already back at his post.<br /> <br /> He again
        greatly distinguished himself on the 1st of September 1796 at
        Greisenfeld and Langenbruck, where the victory of the French was owing
        to a timely attack made by Desaix and himself.<br /> <br /> He was one of
        the generals under Moreau when the latter achieved his well-known
        retreat through the Black Forest, begun on the 15th of September 1796,
        and during which many battles were fought. In one of the actions on the
        banks of the Elz, Beaupuy was killed by a cannon-ball, while opposing
        General Latour on the heights of Malterdingen. His soldiers, who loved
        him passionately, fought desperately to avenge his death (Oct. 19,
        1796).<br /> <br /> One of Beaupuy's colleagues, General Duhem, in his
        account of the battle to the Government, thus expressed himself on
        General Beaupuy:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Ecrivains patriotes, orateurs chaleureux, je vous propose un noble
          sujet, l'&eacute;loge du G&eacute;neral Beaupuy, de Beaupuy, le Nestor
          et l'Achille de notre arm&eacute;e. Vous n'avez pas de r&eacute;cherches
          &agrave; faire; interrogez le premier soldat de l'arm&eacute;e du
          Rhin-et-Moselle, ses larmes exciteront les v&ocirc;tres. Ecrivez alors
          ce que est vous en dira, et vous peindrez le Bayard de la R&eacute;publique
          Fran&ccedil;aise."
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <a name="fr35B" id="fr35B">Such</a> bombastic style was then common, but
        what we have seen of Beaupuy in this sketch shows that he had through
        his career united Nestor's prudence<a href="#35B"><sup>B</sup></a> with
        Achilles' bodily courage and Bayard's chivalric spirit,&mdash;to use the
        language of the time.<br /> <br /> General Moreau had Beaupuy's remains
        transported to Brisach, where a monument was erected to his memory in
        1802, after the peace of Lun&eacute;ville.<br /> <br /> In <a name="fr35C"
        id="fr35C">short</a>, Beaupuy seems to have always remained worthy of
        the high praise bestowed on him by Wordsworth. His name is to be
        remembered along with those of the unspotted generals of the first years
        of the Revolution&mdash;Hoche, Marceau, etc.&mdash;before the craving
        for conquest had developed, and the love of liberty yielded to a fond
        admiration of Bonaparte as it did in the case of Kleber, Desaix, and so
        many others.<a href="#35C"><sup>C</sup></a><br /> <br /> <i> N. B.</i>&mdash;The
        great influence which Beaupuy exercised at that time on Wordsworth will
        be easily understood, if we take into account not only his real
        qualities, but also his age. When they met, Wordsworth was only
        twenty-one, Beaupuy nearly thirty-five. The grown-up man could impart
        much of his knowledge of life, and of the favourite authors of the time,
        to a youth fresh from the University&mdash;though that youth was
        Wordsworth.<br /> <br /> <b>Emile Legouis</b>.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
