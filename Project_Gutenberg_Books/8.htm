          <p><b>HIGH NOTES BY OUR MUSICAL CRITIC.</b></p>

          <p>PUNCHINELLO'S critic, always the friend of fair-play,
          resents the insinuation that Mr. CARL ROSA has been a
          careless director of Opera. The truth is that Mr. ROSA
          has not produced the smallest work without a great deal
          of Preparation.</p>

          <p>FLOTOW'S <i>Shadow</i> is to be brought out in London.
          It will not stand the ghost of a chance unless well
          mounted. Music light and sketchy; remarkable for a Chorus
          of Fishermen, well known as the "Shad oh! song."</p>

          <p><i>Lohengrin</i> has had a run of eight nights at
          Brussels, with average receipts of little less than four
          thousand francs. This sort of tune is the only one in the
          music of the Future which managers can understand.
          Nevertheless Herr WAGNER is not out of spirits. Intent
          upon laying the foundations of future wealth and fame, he
          can lay Low and Grin. Brussels gold will serve him as
          well as <i>Rheingold</i>.</p>

          <p>The difference between BACH'S music find a music-box
          is yet an unsettled conundrum. Such is likely to be the
          fate of the question raised with so much temper over the
          Passion Music of that great man by the English critics.
          Shame on all critics that condemn MOZART as a fogy and
          BACH as a nuisance. Of course it is going back on BACH
          with a vengeance, but what sympathy can exist between the
          old fuguemakers and the modern high-flyers?</p><br>

          <p><b>WHAT I KNOW ABOUT PROTECTION.</b></p>

          <p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO: Having skilfully illuminated Free
          Trade, I now proceed to elucidate Protection. You see
          when we reach Protection, the boot is on the other leg;
          <i>you</i> make the conundrums then, and the other man
          tries to guess them. There are many kinds of protection;
          there's the kind which a State's prison-keeper gives to
          one of his birds; the kind which a black-and-tan terrier,
          or a freshly-imported Chinaman, extends to a good fat
          rat; the kind which a pious young man offers to a fair
          and tender damsel, when he places his arm around her
          dainty waist, and gently absorbs the dew of innocence
          from her rosy lips, (that idea, is, I think, plagiarized
          from TENNYSON,) and the kind which a delicate
          mother-in-law, blessed with nerves, pours out upon her
          son-in-law. But I leave the discussion of such things to
          weaker birds, and soar myself to a higher kind,
          <i>i.e.</i>, that Protection which is diametrically
          opposed to Free Trade.</p>

          <p>Protection, in this sense, is&mdash;well, let me
          follow my own admirable example, and illustrate: You own
          a coal mine in Pennsylvania, which contains tolerably
          poor coal, with which you mix a proper amount of stone,
          and then sell the mixture for a high price. ICHABOD
          BLUE-NOSE owns a coal mine in Nova Scotia, which
          furnishes good coal; he puts no slate in it, and yet
          sells it at a low figure. You reflect that with such
          opposition you will never manage to dispose of all your
          stone, so you apply to Congress, and have a high tariff
          put on coal. That's Protection. Metaphysically defined,
          Protection is the natural right, inherent in every
          American citizen, to obtain money in large quantities for
          goods of small qualities.</p>

          <p>Protection is not a natural production; it was
          invented about the time taxes were, though it must be
          admitted that those very annoying articles appeared very
          early in the history of the human race. I've no doubt
          that ADAM levied taxes, though it's very doubtful if he
          could put as many things in a tax levy as a New York
          politician can. Certainly there was a very high tariff on
          apples in his day&mdash;so high that humanity has not yet
          succeeded in paying off the duty on the one ADAM ate.
          ABRAHAM paid taxes, and, as he was his own Senate and
          House, doubtless he passed a tariff bill to suit himself,
          and had any quantity of Protection. I have always
          regretted that NOAH didn't pass a bill protecting native
          industry, because he could have enforced it, and had no
          wrangling about it.</p>

          <p>There are one or two points about Protection which a
          wayfaring man, even if people labor under the impression
          that he is a fool, can understand. If you are JOHN SMITH
          and own a coal mine or an iron mill, you go to
          Washington, see your Congressman, (by see I mean look at
          him, of course,) donate large sums of money to certain
          poor, but honest men, who adorn the lobby of the House,
          while they are waiting for generous patrons like unto
          you, then go home and calmly await the result. Your
          representative makes a speech, the exordium of which is
          Patriotism, the peroration of which is Star-Spangled
          Banner, and the central plum of which is your coal mine
          or iron mill. Your poor and honest friends wear out
          several pairs of shoes, the tariff bill is passed, your
          mine or mill is abundantly protected, and the country is
          saved. If, on the other hand, you are JOHN BROWN, and
          raise cabbages and turnips on a farm, you are allowed to
          pay high prices for SMITH'S coal or iron, but you expect
          no Protection, and you've a sure thing of getting what
          you expect.</p>

          <p>Of course you don't imagine that I shall explain the
          details of this profound subject. There are only two men
          in this country who think they can do that, and each one
          of those says that the other is an idiot. As a rule,
          figures can't lie; but look out for the exceptions when
          you run across the subject of Protection. The very same
          figures have an ugly way of proving both sides of a
          question. You run down a fact, and think you've got it,
          but, before you know it, it has slipped, like the "little
          joker," over to the other side.</p>

          <p>Personally, I am a Protectionist. Formerly I indulged
          in that monstrous absurdity, Free Trade, but then I was
          an importer; now, being a manufacturer, the scales have
          fallen from my eyes, and I am of the straitest sect a
          Protectionist. You can't give me too much of it. Of
          course I can't see why pig-iron should be protected, and
          pigs not. I think every native production should be cared
          for, and that there should be an excessively high tariff
          on foreign food. In that case poor REVERDY JOHNSON would
          have been compelled to have passed a Lenten season at
          Halifax, until he had eradicated from his system the rich
          English dinners, before he could have entered this
          favored land. And MOTLEY&mdash;bless me, he has eaten so
          much that I don't believe he could get it out of his body
          if he fasted for the remainder of his natural life.</p>

          <p>I am informed, however, that Protection does us one
          injury. All the <i>World</i> says that there is a Parsee
          in our land, who is loaded with rupees, but who is unable
          to spend them here because of our protective system, and
          what all the <i>World</i> says, you know, must be true.
          However, there are 40,000,000 of us, and, if Congress
          will make all Americans buy my patent door-knobs, the
          Parsee can go to&mdash;Hindostan.</p>

          <p>I don't think any thing more can be said about
          Protection. Any body who doesn't understand it now had
          better go to Washington, and listen to the debate on
          scrap-iron. That will sharpen his wits. Pig-iron, of
          course, is interesting, but then that's a light and airy
          subject. Hear the debate on scrap-iron, by all means.</p>

          <p><b>A LITERARY VAMPIRE.</b></p>

          <p>No greater mistake was ever made than the supposition
          that PUNCHINELLO is to be assailed with impunity by rival
          publications. It is well known that he never courted
          controversies or quarrels, and his best friends
          understand perfectly his love for a peaceable career. But
          when that flippant sheet, known as <i>Rees's American
          Encyclopedia</i>, comes out with a violent attack upon
          PUNCHINELLO'S past life and present course, the assault
          is such as would provoke a retort from any honest man.
          The vile insinuation that PUNCHINELLO is printed and
          published for the sole purpose of making money out of its
          subscribers and the reading public in general, is too
          mendacious for refutation; and when the reckless editor
          of the periodical in question gravely announces that he
          can never read PUNCHINELLO without laughing at its
          contents, it will be readily seen that he goes so far as
          to make use of the truth to serve his wicked purposes.
          But the descent which this shameless conductor of a
          journal, confessedly the organ of our ignorant masses,
          has made into the private life of PUNCHINELLO, is without
          precedent. He states that for the first fourteen years of
          his life, PUNCHINELLO was, to all intents and purposes, a
          person of little or no fortune, and that he depended
          entirely upon his parents for support; that, until he had
          reached his fifth birthday, he had absolutely no
          knowledge of English literature, and was entirely
          ignorant of even the rudiments of the classics; that he
          never paid one cent of income tax at that period of his
          life; and that his belief in the fundamental principles
          of political economy was, at that time, doubted by all
          who knew him best! Are such statements as these to be
          submitted to by a man of honor? Never! PUNCHINELLO dares
          the recreant editor of the dirty sheet to do his worst!
          Of that base man he could tell much which would render
          him unfit for the association of any person living, but
          he forbears. This much, however, he will say. It is well
          known that the said calumniator did, at many periods of
          his life, make use of the services of a
          <i>calceolarius</i>. Think of that, freemen of America!
          He has often been known to submit to indignities, such as
          nose-pulling from the hands of a common <i>tonsor</i>,
          and has been frequently in such a condition that he could
          not appear in public without the assistance of a
          <i>sartor</i>! Is it fitting that a high-toned journalist
          should engage in petty recriminations with such a one?
          "Revenge," says JAMES MURDOCK, "is the sweetest morsel
          cooked in its own gravy, with <i>sauce moyennaise</i>."
          "Yes," said Dean SWIFT, "and let us have some, and a
          little gin, say five fingers, and a trifle of milk." Thus
          it is that we regard the editor of the
          <i>Encyclopedia</i>.</p>

          <p>CARLYLE remarks, "Many a vessel, (for if not a Vessel,
          then surely we, or our progenitors, in counting ships,
          and the assumptive floatative mechanisms of anterior and
          past ages; or as the Assyrians [under-estimating the
          force of the correlative elements] declared a bridging,
          or a going over [not of seas merely, but of those chaotic
          gaps of the mind] are all wrong enough indeed,) has never
          got there."</p>

          <p>We also think of that editor in this way, and trust
          that enough has been said to make it plain that
          PUNCHINELLO is not to be attacked with impunity by every
          little journal of the day.</p><br>

          <p>The managers of a leading railroad announce that they

          Change is so scarce with many people, ought to insure for
          that railroad a great success.</p><br>

          <p><b>THE PLAYS AND SHOWS.</b></p>

          <p><img src="images/05.jpg" align="left" alt="M">ilitary
          dramas might, as a rule, be called with equal propriety
          millinery dramas. In other words, their success is
          generally due to their costumes. In this respect they
          afford a marked contrast to ballet spectacles. The latter
          give us inanity without clothes; the former, inanity in
          particularly gorgeous clothes. Which, again, leads to the
          further remark that the difference between the two styles
          of inanity is, after all, a clothes thing. This is a
          joke.</p>

          <p>The <i>Lancers</i>, now running at WALLACK'S, (a
          proceeding which implies no want of bravery on the part
          of that distinguished corps,) is, however, unlike most
          military dramas, inasmuch as it is a bright and brilliant
          play. Moreover, it is acted by the best members of the
          Company in their very best manner. Miss LOUISA MOORE,
          whose golden hair and silvery voice become an actress of
          genuine mettle as well as gentle grace, is ESTELLE, the
          heroine; Miss EMILY MESTAYER is the Commanding Sister of
          Col. EP&#201;E who is personated by Mr. FISHER; Mr.
          WYNDHAM is the Graceless Private, who, having spent his
          last penny, enlists in the Lancers and spends vast sums
          in beneficiary beer in company with his comrades; Mr.
          WILLIAMSON is the Kindly Sergeant; Mr. RINGGOLD is the
          Genial Artist, whose velvet coat suggests that he has
          recently managed a Starr <i>opera bouffe</i> enterprise;
          and Mr. STODDART is happy in the congenial character of a
          Clumsy Trumpeter. If any speculative manager pretends
          that he has a better hypothetical cast in his eye than
          the present cast of the <i>Lancers</i>, let him be given
          to the surgical tormentors to be operated upon for
          malignant <i>strabismus</i>.</p>

          <p>The curtain rises upon the Genial Artist searching for
          his friend, the Graceless Private, in the empty jugs and
          glasses at the <i>Golden Sun Inn</i>. To him enters the
          Clumsy Trumpeter.</p>

          <p><i>Genial Artist</i>. "Where can he be? It&mdash;it
          must, and yet&mdash;"</p>

          <p><i>Clumsy Trumpeter (without Stoddart's usual
          oath.)</i> "He's got 'em. Hallo! friend. Do you want any
          thing?"</p>

          <p><i>Genial Artist</i>. "Yes&mdash;no&mdash;that
          is&mdash;or rather it isn't&mdash;" (<i>Exit, while
          Trumpeter makes faces at the gallery</i>.)</p>

          <p><i>Enter</i> ESTELLE <i>and her maid, disguised as
          peasants, and pursued by a troop of lancers</i>.</p>

          <p><i>All the Lancers</i>. "Let <i>me</i> kiss 'em."</p>

          <p><i>Graceless Private</i>. "I will protect you. Get
          out, all you fellows." (<i>They get out</i>.)</p>

          <p>A flirtation between the Private and ESTELLE is at
          once begun, from which it appears that she came to catch
          a glimpse of the Colonel, who wants to marry her. She and
          the Private sit on the table, and fall instantaneously in
          love. As soon as they are well in, the Lancers return,
          and ESTELLE flies. Graceless Private, having no money,
          pays for the co-inebriation of the entire corps, and
          while engaged in this praiseworthy occupation is found by
          the Genial Artist, who makes him promise to attend a ball
          at a neighboring <i>ch&#226;teau</i>. Enter Kindly
          Sergeant, who arrests the Graceless Private, and puts him
          in the guard-house. Curtain falls amid faces from

          poet.) Clumsy Trumpeter drops books and things all over
          the room, and recognises the Graceless Private. Finally
          the Colonel and the latter quarrel, and go out in the
          back yard to fight, where the Private is wounded in the
          arm. The Colonel returns and announces the result to</i>
          ESTELLE, <i>who swoons, or at all events, makes an
          admirable feint of so doing. Curtain.</i></p>

          <p><i>Fast Young Man</i>. "STODDART didn't try his good
          joke to-night. He'll say something yet, though, before
          the play is over."</p>

          <p><i>Every body Else</i>. "Did you ever see better
          acting than WYNDHAM'S and Miss MOORE'S? And how capitally
          FISHER and Miss MESTAYER are playing? STODDART positively
          hasn't sworn yet. What can be the matter with him?"</p>

          <p><i>Inquiring Maiden, to her travelled lover</i>. "Are
          the uniforms just like those of the real French
          Lancers?"</p>

          <p><i>Travelled Lover</i>. "Very nearly. There is one
          button too many on the front of the Colonel's coat. I
          know the regiment well. It's the crack artillery regiment
          in the French service."</p>

          <p><i>Act III. shows us the Graceless Private brought
          before the Colonel for examination. He feigns
          drunkenness, but the Colonel suspects him of having been
          his adversary at the ball</i>. ESTELLE <i>visits the
          Colonel in order to save her Private lover. He is proved
          to have broken his arrest, and is sentenced to death</i>.
          ESTELLE <i>offers to marry the Colonel if he will pardon
          the Private. The latter's discharge arrives in the nick
          of time, and as he is thus beyond the reach of the
          Colonel's vengeance, he graciously pardons him, and joins
          his hand to that of</i> ESTELLE. <i>He remarks&mdash;or
          ought to&mdash;"Bless you, my children." Every body
          suddenly finds out that every body else is noble and
          generous. And so the curtain falls upon a happy garrison,
          including a Trumpeter who has not sworn a single
          oath</i>.</p>

          <p><i>One Half of the Audience</i>. "How do you like it?
          I like it so much."</p>

          <p><i>The Other Half</i>. "I like it immensely."</p>

          <p><i>Chorus from Every body</i>. "Why didn't STODDART
          swear?"</p>

          <p><i>Answering Echo from the Tipperary Hills</i>.
          "Because WALLACK has told him that the public won't stand
          it any longer."</p>

          <p>And the public is right. Mr. STODDART is an
          exceptionally able actor, but of late he has grown
          intolerably coarse and vulgar while on the stage. His
          profanity has disgraced himself and the theatre, and his
          gratuitous insult to an estimable lady, who had the
          misfortune to appear in the same scene with him on Monday
          night, should have secured his instant dismissal from the
          company, and his perpetual banishment to <i>Tammany</i>
          or <i>Tony Pastor's</i>. Let him turn over a new leaf at
          once. He does not swear in the present play, and the fact
          is creditable to him. He is a gentleman in private life;
          let him be a gentleman on the stage. By so doing he will
          soon be recognized as one of the best comedians of the
          day. And PUNCHINELLO will be the first to praise him when
          he lays aside the unnecessary vulgarity with which he has
          latterly bid for the applause of the gallery.</p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">GLIMPSES OF FORTUNE.</p>

          <p>You may not think so, my dear PUNCHINELLO, but it is
          true. I have had them. I am not one of your bloated
          aristocrats&mdash;just at the present moment&mdash;but I
          know as well as any one what WHITTIER meant when he said
          "it might have been." As an instance of this, I will just
          state that it has not been a very long time since, in
          looking over the columns of one of our principal dailies,
          I saw something among the personals which seemed to touch
          my interests in, a very decided way. I often look over
          the "Personals," for I know well the connection between
          fortune and the Press. I have not forgotten the success
          of A.T. STEWART and many other millionaires, and their
          dependence on the newspapers&mdash;but never until that
          day had I seen any thing in that mystic column which
          could possibly be construed to apply to inc. As for the
          rest of the paper, I knew that there was nothing to
          interest me there. You see I was after Fortune. The
          advertisement to which I refer road as follows:</p>

          <p>"If the gentleman in a dark hat and gray pantaloons,
          who, in a Broadway stage, one day last week, passed up
          the fare for a lady with blue eyes and high-heeled boots,
          will call at 831 Dash street, second floor, he will hear
          of something to his advantage. A.R.R."</p>

          <p>Now, it so happened, that during the whole of the
          preceding week I had worn a black hat and gray
          pantaloons; indeed, I had them on yet, and, to tell the
          truth, I had no others. Therefore, this part of the case
          was all clear enough. There was no reason why the
          gentleman inquired for should not be me. I had certainly
          ridden in a stage in the last week, and I remember very
          well that I passed up the fare for lady with blue eyes. I
          performed a similar service for several ladies; but one
          of them, I am sure, had blue eyes. As to the high-heeled
          boots I suppose she wore them, but how was I to know
          that? At all events it would be a piece of the most
          culpable indifference to my welfare to neglect this
          chance. Fortune! and through a lady, too! To think of it!
          The promised advantage might be great or small, but
          whatever it was, it would be most welcome. And the honor,
          too! A piece of positive advantage for an act of manly
          gallantry!</p>

          <p>I immediately put on that black hat, and with those
          identical gray trowsers upon my legs, I strode down to
          321 Dash street, and mounted instantly to the second
          floor. As there was but one entrance door from the
          stair-way on this floor, I felt certain that I had found
          the right place.</p>

          <p>The business of Mr. A.R.R. was evidently a very
          profitable one, for his room was quite full of people. I
          inquired of a boy for the author of the notice I held in
          my hand, (I had carefully cut it from the paper,) and was
          informed that this was the right place, and that the
          gentleman would see me in a few moments. I took a seat
          and regarded the persons who were standing and sitting
          about the room. They were all men, and in a few minutes I
          discovered, to my great surprise, that they all wore
          black hats and gray pantaloons!</p>

          <p>I must admit, that when I made this discovery, I
          experienced a very peculiar sensation, as if some one had
          suddenly dropped a little ice-water down my back. Was it
          possible that all these men were here in answer to that
          advertisement, which I considered addressed to me alone?
          There were all sorts of them; old gentlemen with heads
          grayer than their pants; young fellows who looked like
          clerks; and middle-aged men, who seemed like very
          respectable heads of families. Was it possible that each
          one of those individuals had, in the last week, passed up
          the fare of a blue-eyed lady with high-heeled boots? And
          did each one of them expect to enjoy that advantage for
          which I came here? One thing was certain; they did not
          announce to each other their business, but looked at
          their watches and tapped their boots, and knitted their
          brows as if each one of them had come on very particular
          business, which had nothing to do with the affairs of the
          general crowd. But all those gray trowsers! There was no
          concealing them.</p>

          <p>A door, leading into an adjoining room, now opened
          quickly, and Mr. A.R.R. made his appearance. No one
          doubted that he was the man, for he bowed politely, and
          seemed to expect the company. He was a tall, thin, and
          well-dressed man, and held in his hand a small package.
          Instantly upon his appearance every man in the room stuck
          his thumb and forefinger into his vest pocket, and
          pulling out a little piece of printed paper, said, "Sir,
          I called&mdash;" A.R.R. waved his hand.</p>

          <p>"Gentlemen," said he, "I know why you called, and you
          will allow me to remark&mdash;"</p>

          <p>"But look here," said a tall man with a blue cravat.
          "I think that I am the person you want to see, and as I
          am in a hurry, I would like to see you for a few minutes
          in private."</p>

          <p>Dozens of angry eyes were now directed upon this
          presumptuous individual, and dozens of angry voices were
          about to break forth when the benign A.R.R. again waved
          his hand.</p>

          <p>"Gentlemen," said he, "I wish to see you all. No one
          more than another. I have reason to believe that every
          one of you is the person to whom that advertisement
          referred. I see you are all gentlemen, and you would not
          have made your appearance here had you not fulfilled the
          conditions mentioned in the paper."</p>

          <p>Here was a smothered hum, which seemed to precede a
          general outbreak, but A.R.R., blandly smiling,
          continued:</p>

          <p>"Gentlemen, do not become impatient. What I have to
          say is to the advantage of every one of you. You all move
          in good society&mdash;I can see that&mdash;and you
          therefore are well aware of some of the penalties of
          social pleasures and high living. Consequently,
          gentlemen," and now he spoke very fast, as if fearful of
          interruption, "you must have, all of you, experienced
          some of the evils of indigestion, and it is to relieve
          these that I have prepared my Binocular Barberry
          Bitters&mdash;"</p>

          <p>A roar of rage here broke forth from every man of us,
          and a rush was made towards the smiling impostor, but he
          quickly slipped through the door behind him, and locked
          it in our faces. And then, before we could rush from the
          room where we had been so shamefully duped, the head of
          A.R.R. appeared at a little window in the partition-wall,
          and he called out:</p>

          <p>"Gentlemen, this mixture is, as my initials declare, a
          Radical Relief, and retails at one dollar per bottle, I
          hope you will take some of my circulars home with you,"
          and he threw among the crowd the package of circulars
          which he had held in his hand.</p>

          <p>This, O friend PUNCHINELLO, was only one of my
          Glimpses of Fortune. I may yet see the jade more nearly.
          IMPECUNE.</p><br>

          <p>Observe PUNCHINELLO'S Cartoon, in which you shall
          behold the editorial laundresses of New-York city having
          a washy time of it all around. There is a, shriek of
          objurgation in the air, and a flutter of soiled linen on
          the breeze. Granny MARBLE, to the extreme left of the

          looks fight at Granny JONES, of the <i>Times</i>. The

          like the sun in a fog. But the real <i>Sun</i> in a fog
          is to be seen to the extreme right. There you behold
          Granny DANA, shaking her "brawny bunch of fives" in the
          face of Granny YOUNG, whose manner of wringing out the
          linen, you will observe, is up to the highest
          <i>Standard</i> of that branch of art. Further away,
          Granny TILTON flutters her linen with spiteful flourish,
          nettled by the vituperation of Granny HASTINGS, who hangs
          up her <i>Commercial</i> clothes on the line. The

          hoped that all the U-Lye soaps used by the washerwomen is

          <p><b>JUMBLES</b>.</p>

          <p>MR. PUNCHINELLO, do you know when a woman is
          perfection itself? "No." I do. It is when she is from
          sixteen to nineteen. Of course you take her judgment. At
          sixteen she is the coming flower that has come&mdash;the
          first Rose of Summer, and about the best that may be
          looked for. Her ideas may not be solid, but they are
          expansive. Her mind may not make a very great show, but
          her hair (real and otherwise) is sure to. She is very
          deep in love&mdash;with herself. The supremest divinity
          is seen when she looks in the mirror. Call her ARABELLA
          if you like. ARABELLA is mistress of that portion of the
          dictionary which includes the common-place compliments of
          society. In her mouth they have a common place, indeed.
          Some people call such utterances "stuff," "nonsense,"
          "puerilities," but nobody is so prejudiced and unreliable
          as the above-named some people. They complacently think
          they know a thing or two, but that is all it amounts to.
          ARABELLA hasn't any doubt about her being perfection.
          Unfortunately there is a question about some matters in
          this world in politics, religion, morality and other
          kindred things, but on the doctrine of perfection, as
          applied to her individual self, ARABELLA is clear and
          settled. Did any body, she says <i>sotto voce</i>, to
          herself, ever put vision on such an ensemble countenance?
          Were eyes ever more sparkling? Were ever dimples dimpler?
          Had ever peach such artistic hue, and teeth such pearly
          pearliness, and lips such positive sweetness, and brow
          such loveliness? We suppose not. ARABELLA is eighteen, is
          of elastic notions, sees life as a romance, believes the
          ground on which she walks ought to be grateful for the
          honor, and wonders if every body who goes out don't go
          straightway to talking rapturously about her. ARABELLA is
          a type&mdash;the type of a class of perfectionists.
          ARABELLA is neither a worm nor a butterfly, but the
          bridge between. For all this ARABELLA believes herself to
          be the best of butterflies, with the capacity to fly in
          the highest manner. At twenty-five her wings will be
          clipped, her colors will modify, her notions renovate,
          and her eyes open. She will perceive that the doctrine of
          perfection is mythical, and angels upon earth only so in
          name.</p>

          <p>Going to church is a good thing. All good people go,
          and from good motives, of course. Mrs. BROWN, says a
          wicked gossip, goes to show a bonnet; Mrs. JONES her
          shawl; Mrs. SMITH her silk; Mrs. JENKINS her gloves and
          fan. No sane person believes that these ladies go for any
          such purpose. The case isn't presumable. They are nice,
          high-toned people, sit in $800 pews, adore Rev. Dr.
          CANTWELL, and give very freely (of their husband's money)
          to the heathen in the uttermost corners of the earth.
          They prefer, good souls, to give to the heathen under the
          equator to those under their noses. It is <i>not</i> true
          that ladies go to church for the display of dress. It
          <i>is</i> true Mrs. JONES does not wish to be outdone by
          Mrs. JENKINS, and isn't if STEWART can help it, but she
          is a good pious woman of simple tastes, though Mr. J.
          thinks she tastes rather often. Going to church is a good
          thing for example's sake. It is so nice and strengthening
          to reflect that, as the minister preaches piety, and you
          practice poetry, (with a pencil in the prayer-book,) you
          set an example to the rising generation. One can never do
          too much for the rising generation, though it often rises
          too frequently and too high. Besides, it encourages the
          minister. Only think of talking to emptiness instead of
          fulness&mdash;to people instead of plush. How can the
          dear Rev. SPLURGE SPLUTTER have the heart or tongue to
          drop his pearls of eloquence to the swine of empty pews?
          And how dreadful for the gifted soprano, Miss SCREECH, to
          tune her melodious voice to earless aisles! And then it
          is so easy to "set" examples by sitting in soft pews,
          doing to church should be a matter of conscience. Every
          body not a dolt admits conscience to be a good thing,
          though a thing every body cannot boast of possessing. I
          like people of conscience&mdash;that is, I should like
          them if I knew any. It is such a nice thing to talk
          about&mdash;and how much nicer to have. Mrs. TODD often
          wishes "to conscience" she could reach mine. I am sorry
          to say that at times Mrs. T. is an irreverent woman. She
          doesn't perceive that some where under that hairless,
          proud dome of mine there must be a conscience&mdash;I may
          proudly say, an imposing conscience. I said to Mrs. T.
          one day, "I <i>have</i> an imposing conscience," and she
          really thought so&mdash;adding the cruel expression that
          she didn't know of any thing about me but <i>was</i>
          imposing, and that she first became aware of the sad fact
          when she married me.</p>

          <p>The situation of France is always striking. This is
          because its people are always being struck with a
          succession of Napoleonic ideas. They labor, for example,
          under a constant <i>coup d'etat</i>. Their Press is the
          victim of a regular <i>coup de main</i>; their Strikes
          are daily evidences of <i>coups de mains</i>; their
          Legislature suffers continually from <i>coup de
          th&#233;&#226;tre</i>; and their Emperor is
          perpetually threatened with a <i>coup de grace</i>. The
          energies of Frenchmen are not imprisoned; no, they are

          <p><b>ELEVATED STATESMANSHIP&mdash;INSOBRIETY THE BEST
          POLICY.</b></p>

          <p>Sir JOHN MACDONALD, the Premier of Canada, though an
          eccentric leader, is a happy illustration of the most
          elevated statecraft. "He has been drunk," says the
          Toronto <i>Globe</i>, "for several days, and
          incapacitated for public affairs." Considering what
          Canadian affairs are (including Sir JOHN,) this does not
          follow. Evidently it is not his policy to keep sober. But
          Sir JOHN is often drunk, says the <i>Globe</i>; he was
          tight before Prince ARTHUR, and he rushes to the bottle
          whenever the Fenians give alarm. Now this strikes us as
          very good policy. It helps us to see how convenient it
          was for Sir JOHN to magnify a few O'BRIENS and
          O'SHAUGHNESSYS into an army with green banners, and how
          opportunely the Dominion became intoxicated with its
          fears.</p><br>

          <p>THE VIPER.</p>

          <p>The supposition that this snake prefers a file to any
          other species of nourishment is a vulgar error, and
          belongs to the same mendacious category as the stories
          that ostriches are fond of ten-penny nails and soldiers
          of hard tack. It is true that old files are sometimes
          bitten by vipers in localities where these serpents
          abound, but in the lizard and hop-toad they usually find
          metal more attractive. The viper, when in a state of
          repose, is of an olive-brown color; but, if trodden upon,
          turns rusty. He is about twenty-four inches in length, as
          you may see by applying a two-foot rule to him, but it is
          a good rule to keep two feet away from him. As a bosom
          friend he is not to be trusted&mdash;a fact in natural
          history that was discovered many years ago by a green
          countryman, who got into a bad box by placing a viper on
          his chest. It is a peculiarity of this serpent, that when
          held suspended by his posterior extremity he can not
          raise his head to a level with his tail. In consequence
          of this provision in the economy of nature, he finds it
          as impossible to make both ends meet as if he were a
          human prodigal. In this respect he presents a marked
          contrast to the hoop-snake, which has no more back-bone
          than a timid politician, and can put its tail in its
          mouth, and roll in any direction with the utmost
          facility. The viper was at one time supposed to have an
          envenomed tongue, and although this error has been
          exploded, it is as well to avoid his jaw if possible, as,
          when irritated, he is very snappish.</p>

          <p>This snake, according to some naturalists, is
          oviparous, and according to others viviparous; but all
          authorities agree that it is viperous in the extreme.
          Serpents are generated in various ways; the horse-runner,
          for instance, being derived from the fibres of horses'
          manes and tails, which probably receive the breath of
          life in a mare's nest. That such is the origin of the
          horse-runner the reader can verify for himself, by
          putting a few horse hairs in a basin of water and
          watching them till they begin to squirm. Possibly the
          shorter fibres from the <i>caput</i> of an African might
          in like manner produce vipers. The experiment is worth
          trying. There are several varieties of the species in
          this country; the most malignant and treacherous being
          the Political Vipers&mdash;snakes in the grass&mdash;bred
          from the spawn of the Original Cockatrices, and a curse
          to the land we live in.</p><br>

          <p><b>WOMAN IN THE CENSUS.</b></p>

          <p>A fresh blow has been struck at Woman's Rights!
          Gallant ladies, eager to cope with figures, have been
          compelled to yield to numbers&mdash;inferior numbers at
          that! Man, the minority, remains the popular tyrant of
          population. Women, the majority, don't count, can't count
          for any thing&mdash;even for women&mdash;at least in the
          sense of being Census-takers; for General WALKER has
          decided that Assistant Marshals LAVINIA PURLEAR and SARAH
          BURGOYNE (hear it, shades of NEY and BLUCHER!) are
          ineligible to such a warlike title. General WALKER is not
          firm in his mind that Marshals PURLEAR and BURGOYNE
          [would it be as well to say Marshal WALKER and Generals
          PURLEAR and BURGOYNE?] are feminine. "These appear to be
          the names of women," he says. Why might they not be the
          names of men? Is there no right or reason in these days
          of domestic revolution for men to name themselves LAVINIA
          and SARAH if they like it, and their wives like it? And
          suppose LAVINIA and SARAH that ought to be, or might have
          been, choose to call themselves MAHALALEEL and
          METHUSALEM&mdash;who's to prevent? Why should not the
          Rev. Mr.---- style himself Miss NANCY if he pleases? Why
          should not the Hon. Mr.---- rechristen himself BETTY if
          he has a mind to? H'm! A pretty pass we are coming to if
          these women folks who ask men's rights and take men's
          names won't lend us theirs! And alas, alas, ye lasses!
          What if some-day ye do indeed abstract our census, and
          marshal us into helpless minority. What if we have to
          disguise ourselves, and shave our beards, and change our
          names even to get on the police! Or will ye&mdash;ye
          bullying Syrens!&mdash;grow whiskers and wear pantaloons,
          and put us in station-houses, and clear us out of the

          <p><b>A LETTER FROM A FRIEND.</b></p>

          <p>Friend PUNCHINELLO: Thee has doubtless sorrowed, in
          spite of thy motley, with those bereft at Richmond.
          Circumstances made that disaster a calamity which we have
          all felt in common. But thee knows that "Blessings come
          often in disguise." Let us find what small comfort we can
          in this thought.</p>

          <p>Circumstances, however, alter cases. How different the
          feeling&mdash;how thin the disguise would have
          been&mdash;had our Capitol fallen, at Harrisburg! Before
          another Session we trust the proper spirit will move some
          underpinning there, for the greater good of the
          Commonwealth. It was formerly said that "Law is law;" but
          not even a Philadelphia lawyer now knows what law is or
          what law is not&mdash;for "any thing" is law here abouts.
          Of one result we may boast, if that be not sinful, we are
          ahead of thy wicked city.. Thee had thy delinquent Tax
          Collector, <i>but thee has him not</i>. We sorrowed, for
          we had him not, but now we rejoice in one whose name
          is&mdash;not BAILEY&mdash;but HILL. We did not want him,
          but got him involuntarily, as thee might get the
          small-pox.</p>

          <p>Doubtless he will make it more up-Hill work than ever
          with our taxes, but, if he would only shoulder them and
          be off, what a blessing? For, verily, it cannot be said,
          as of old, that a man "heapeth up riches, and knoweth not
          who shall gather them."</p>

          <p>But, perhaps, thee pays taxes also? If so, thee can
          affirm to the gatherer, as well as thy friend,</p>

          <p>PHINEAS BRODBRIMME.</p>

          <p><b>CONDENSED CONGRESS.</b></p>

          <p><b>SENATE.</b></p>

          <p><img src="images/13.jpg" align="left" alt="">MR.
          MORRILL expressed his views upon what he is pleased, for
          MORRILL is mirthful in his heavy way, to designate the
          reduction of taxes. He said that we had been for some
          time in a state of peace, and our expenses were not so
          large as they had been. Therefore he thought we might
          leave direct taxation alone. To be sure he was not
          prepared to suggest any specific reductions in direct
          taxation. But, doubtless, they would be made some day or
          other. In the meantime let us pile on the tariff. This
          was his notion of reducing taxation. Let the importers
          and the consumers who don't like
          it&mdash;</p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Learn how
          sublime a thing it is</span><br>
          <span style="margin-left: 1em;">To suffer and be
          strong.</span><br>

          <p>Then the Senate betook itself to considering an
          appropriation for educating the colored infant. Mr.
          WILSON strongly approved it, not only on account of the
          colored infant, for whose education he did not in a
          general way feel any particular solicitude, inasmuch as
          the less educated he was, the likelier he would be to
          give his voice and vote to him, (Mr. WILSON,) and his
          like; but also because the appropriation would provide
          for a number of the supernumerary female school-teachers
          of Massachusetts, who had become a great trial to him,
          and particularly to his colleague, Mr. SUMNER.</p>

          <p>Mr. SUMNER said "that's school," and explained that he
          believed he was venerated by the women of Massachusetts,
          but that their reverence for him was too great to allow
          them to approach him with importunities. Nevertheless, he
          was in favor of the bill, as tending to break down the
          accursed spirit of caste, and to disseminate throughout
          the South the three or more R's which he had so often had
          the honor of reverberating throughout the Senate.</p>

          <p>Mr. YATES approved of the bill. It was his general
          principle to vote for any thing that looked to the
          disbursement of money. He was particularly in favor of
          this measure, because he wanted an uniform education for
          every body. He didn't want any body else to know more
          than himself, and he didn't want to know more than any
          body else. (Voices&mdash;You don't.) Take spelling. There
          was only one correct method of spelling&mdash;the one
          that he pursued. And yet he had never found any other
          person who agreed with him in it. Evidently, this was not
          right. He demanded that the children of the country
          should be taught to spell on proper principles, so that
          his works might be intelligible to posterity, as they
          were not to his contemporaries.</p>

          <p>Of course Mr. SUMNER seized the occasion to quote
          crowds of authorities on education, which debilitated the
          Senate to a dissolution.</p>

          <p><b>HOUSE.</b></p>

          <p>Mr. LYNCH wanted to revive American commerce in behalf
          of the ship-builders of Maine. If he were a judge, as a
          celebrated namesake of his once was, he would do it by
          hanging a majority of members of the House he had the
          honor of addressing. In default of that he wanted them to
          legislate sensibly upon it.</p>

          <p>Of course nobody paid any attention to the suggestion.
          The House did itself credit by refusing one land-grab,
          out of a thousand or so submitted.</p>

          <p>Mr. BUTLER actually produced again his bill to annex
          San Domingo, and refused to be comforted, because every
          body laughed.</p>

          <p>Then came up the Tariff. COVODE said he supposed it
          would be admitted that he had as little regard for the
          right and wrong of the thing as any body. But this thing
          had really gone so far that any man with any regard for
          his re-election must protest. Nobody but SCHENCK and
          KELLEY cared about the tariff. Every body cared about the
          taxes.</p>

          <p>SCHENCK could not regard COVODE with any other
          sentiment than disgust. He wanted a duty upon foreign
          oysters. The oyster of Long Island and the oyster of
          New-Jersey ought not to be trodden down by the pauper
          oysters of Europe.</p><br>
          <hr style="width: 45%;">
          <br>

          <p><b>OUR PORTFOLIO.</b></p>

          <p>Personal advertisements having reference to the
          matrimonial exigencies of divers widows, old maids, and
          bachelors, are not without their influence upon the
          sympathies of the age. Particular attention has been
          recently directed toward an announcement made in a
          Cleveland paper to the effect that "Two widow ladies,
          strangers in Cleveland, wish to form the acquaintance of
          a limited number of gentlemen with a view to happy
          results. Please address in confidence,&mdash;."</p>

          <p>One involuntarily regrets that a prospect thus bounded
          by an horizon of "happy results" should have been
          confined to a "limited number of gentlemen".</p>

          <p>There is nothing so calculated to impair the
          usefulness of what purports to be a purely benevolent
          enterprise, as its selfishness. If a widow, or any number
          of widows, really possess the means of realizing "happy
          results" with a "limited number of gentlemen," they
          should either remove the limitation themselves, or make
          known the secret to those who would be less sparing of
          the joys which it is capable of communicating. A quack
          who peddles a valuable remedy upon which he may have
          stumbled, and yet refuses to disclose its ingredients for
          the benefit of the whole medical fraternity, violates the
          <i>esprit du corps</i> of the profession, and is by
          general consent deemed a fit person to be kicked out of
          it. Therefore, if any widows or single ladies in
          Cleveland have knowledge of any "happy results" which
          they advertise to share with a limited number of
          gentlemen, we shall deem them unworthy of their sex,
          unless they explain the process by which these results
          are attained, for the benefit of those who are fast
          verging toward the autumnal stage of maidenhood.</p>
          <hr style="width: 25%;">

          <p>It may well be doubted whether the thought ever
          occurred to ADAM that one day or other a hen would be
          charged with the care and custody of a brood of goslings.
          The pastimes of Eden were perhaps not favorable to
          vaticinations in the line of Natural History, but in the
          progress of the world since those most primitive times,
          men have come to contemplate the spectacle of that
          familiar barn-yard fowl made wretched by the aquatic
          propensities of her supposed offspring, without a
          particle of astonishment. The wicked and unfeeling even
          go so far as to seek amusement in her misery. Her
          "ducklings" and other symptoms of maternal agony at
          beholding the feathered darlings tempting the dangers of
          a neighboring duck-pond, do not move their stony breasts.
          On the contrary, they decidedly relish that sort of
          thing, and greet with positive hilarity the efforts of
          some sympathizing rooster to cheer her. Fie, upon such
          natures! If they must have an outlet for their ribaldry,
          let them take PUNCHINELLO'S advice and select such
          instances as that recently furnished in Sacramento, where
          a hen took charge of a nest of kittens, and resolutely
          maintained it against the parent cat. Here the case was
          different. The hen had become a trespasser. She had no
          business with kittens. There was no hypothesis by which
          she could claim them as her own. Kittens are not
          hereditary in the family of fowls, and she knew it. It
          was an usurpation without any pretext of justification.
          What would become of us if such a precedent could be
          extended to the genus Mammalia? Hundreds of rapacious old
          maids would be seizing all sorts and all sizes of babies
          from agonized mothers, and asserting for themselves the
          hallowed duties of maternity. Our infant days would have
          been days of ceaseless motion. We should have been
          shuttle-cocked from maiden to mother and from mother to
          maiden after a fashion calculated to defeat the wise
          purposes of ipecac and paregoric, and to frighten our
          natural curls into a state of painful perpendicularity.
          The mere presentment of such a possibility, carries its
          refutation, and puts the aggressions of this Sacramento
          hen in the category of outrages which all society is
          banded to suppress. If you must laugh, O generation of
          scoffers, make your jokes and gibes the instrument of
          protecting the altars of all such feline households as
          may be thus assailed.</p><br>

          <p>ROME.</p>

          <p>Being uneasy about our agent's course at the Vatican,
          I have come over to Rome to see about it. He is an
          Irishman, with a little of Father TOM in him, and has got
          into a "controversy" with his Holiness about
          infallibility. Our African bishop (otherwise PHELIM
          BURKE) insists that PUNCHINELLO is infallible! The Pope
          says this is ridiculous! Father PHELIM replies that
          "there are two that can play that same game." I found
          them in the midst of this when ANTONELLI ushered me into
          the Papal presence. PIUS was up on his feet, talking
          Latin like a crack student of the Propaganda. PHELIM had
          his sleeves rolled up. ANTONELLI, with a "<i>Pax
          vobiscum</i>" got the two contending powers quieted down;
          and, after a proper salutation from me, we began our
          talk. His Holiness is not much on English. Says he, "I
          speak vat-I-can English." Had he said <i>non possumus</i>
          to it, it would have been better. However, PHELIM
          translated him; so we got on.</p>

          <p>"Your Holiness enjoys, I hope, a good
          constitution?"</p>

          <p>"The <i>constitutio de fide</i> is, indeed, very good.
          Catholics must every where subscribe to it."</p>

          <p>"Dr. D&#213;LLINGER, I trust, don't disturb your
          appetite?" "<i>Anathema maranatha!</i>" which means (said
          PHELIM,) "Oh no, I never mention him." Whereupon PHELIM,
          who had breakfasted on gin-and-milk, began to hum that
          tune. I at once trod upon his toe, and he stopped.</p>

          <p>"On the whole, what does your Holiness think of the
          prospect?"</p>

          <p>"From this window, it is very fine. But I'm getting a
          little dim-sighted.</p>

          <p>"Don't you see that crowd of people coming up?"</p>

          <p>"No I don't&mdash;it's only a herd of cattle from the
          Campagna."</p>

          <p>"Take my glass. There, now; don't you see, I am
          right?"</p>

          <p>"Yes," and the old man crossed himself, "It is so; I
          was mistaken."</p>

          <p>"Thrue for you!" gobbled out PHELIM; "we've got to
          make a note of that! PUNCHINELLO never made the likes of
          a mistake!"</p>

          <p>"But, <i>what's in your glass?</i> I see strange men
          there. GARIBALDI, and MAZZINI, and HYACINTHE,
          STROSSMEYER, D&#213;LLINGER, DUPANLOUP, and CUMMING,
          all together! I see a troop of schoolmasters; a larger
          one of newspaper-venders; and a whole army of
          <i>colporteurs</i>, each with a bag of Bibles on his
          back! And, what do I see? They enter ST. PETER'S; they
          leave the door wide open. Did I hear it? They are singing
          LUTHER'S Hymn!"</p>

          <p>The old man fell now into his seat, and I took the
          glass from him. "Only one of his attacks," said
          ANTONELLI. "He is not quite so strong as he was." "Thrue
          again," said PHELIM. With that sense of propriety for
          which your representative has over been distinguished, I
          took PHELIM by the arm and retired.</p>

          <p>Poor Pius! He means well, and if we only had him for a
          while out West, where I came from, we might make
          something sensible out of him yet. But, when a man will
          live so far away from the Rocky Mountains as away over
          here, what can be expected? We can't civilize the whole
          world at once.</p>

          <p>Father PHELIM, by the way, is to be proposed as the
          new King of Spain. His father's uncle's second cousin by
          the mother's side partook of a good deal of BOURBON.
          That's reason enough, you know especially as they only
          want a King LOG.</p>

          <p>FRANCE.</p>

          <p>Those infernal machines, so called, with&mdash;which
          the Emperor was supposed to be about to be blown up, turn
          out to have been pewter plates. Out of one of them the
          bottom had been cut, and the edges rolled up; and this
          gave rise to a terrible suspicion. Two thousand people
          have been arrested in consequence.</p>

          <p>That <i>Press Ass</i> has been at his blunders again.
          He telegraphed to me that a conspiracy was afloat to
          enact a kind of petticoat government. He meant to tell me
          some gossip about Madame PATTI-CAUX. Then he wanted me to
          believe that the "smaller catechism" talked about at Rome
          was the catechizing of SMALLEY of the Tribune, concerning
          GUSTAVE FLOURENS. That man never will learn.

          <p>POMEROY'S DEMOCRAT for 1870 will be the best newspaper
          ever printed. It has now a larger circulation than ever
          before&mdash;the largest circulation of any political
          paper ever printed, and is now so firmly established it
          can not by any possible means fail.</p>

          <p>Mr. Pomeroy, Editor and Proprietor, will devote his
          entire time and attention to editorial and literary labor
          for <b>THE DEMOCRAT</b> alone, each week adding to the
          power, interest, worth, and variety of the reading matter
          it will contain. With the people to back
          him&mdash;abundant means of his own at his disposal, he
          is devoting his life to this paper, the people who
          support it, the cause it advocates, and the principles it
          defends, without fear, favor, or hope for reward.</p>

          <p>Read the terms and inducements!</p>

          <div style="text-align: left;"></div>

          <p>In addition to its political worth, <b>THE
          DEMOCRAT</b> will each week contain:</p>

          <p>Pomeroy's Saturday Night Chapters. Letters of
          Correspondence. Editorials on different topics. Pomeroy's
          Social Chat with Friends. Terrance McGrant's Letters.
          Full Market Produce, and Money Reports. A Splendid
          Masonic Department. Happenings Here and There. Brief
          Items of Satire, News, Sarcasm, and Burlesque.
          Discriptive Letters of Travels. Occasional "Pomeroy
          Pictures of New York Life." A First-Class Agricultural
          Department.</p>

          <p>In short, everything to make it the best and most
          readable paper in the United States.</p>

          <p>Politically it will be Democratic&mdash;red-hot and
          reliable earnest and continuous in its war against the
          bonded interest of the country, and determined in its
          labors for that earnest Democracy, which believes in the
          <i>restoration</i> and not the <i>reconstruction</i> of
          the Government.</p>

          <p>For sixty subscribers, with $120, a $60 machine.</p>

          <p>For one-hundred subscribers, with $200, a $100

          <p style="text-align: center;"><big><b>IMPORTANT
          NOTICE</b></big></p>

          <p>If you can not conveniently raise subscribers enough to
          entitle you to a machine, as a premium, send what you
          can, with two dollars for each subscriber so sent, and
          the balance in cash for such priced machine as you so
          desire, when the paper and the machine will be sent as
          directed.</p>

          <p>For example, where thirty subscribers and $60 are
          sent, it will require $26 in cash in addition to the
          subscription money to purchase a $56 machine; or, for
          forty subscribers and $80, sixteen dollars additional
          will be required to purchase the same priced machine, and
          son in proportion.</p>

          <p>We offer these unrivalled machines, believing them to
          be the simplest, most durable, useful, and desirable
          sewing machines in the world, with a view to giving
          workingmen, or deserving woman a chance to obtain a

          way.</p>

          <p>There is hardly a township in the United States, but a
          person can, in a day or two, earn for himself a family
          machine, actually worth the price asked for it&mdash;the
          same as sold at, when purchased of Wilcox &amp; Gibbs,
          the manufactures.</p>

          <p>In many cases a few gentlemen might, by sending their
          names to us as subscribers, receive for themselves <b>THE
          DEMOCRAT</b> each week, and a machine for some poor widow
          or other deserving woman, thus giving her the power to
          care for herself and family, and live independant.</p>

          <p>Each machine we send out will be <i>perfect</i>, and
          of the very best.</p>

          <p>Address all letters on business connected with the

          City.</p>

          <p>Letters on political matters should be addressed to
          M.M. Pomeroy, and if the writer wishes them to be seen
          only by the person to whom they are address, they should
          be marked private, when, if Mr. Pomeroy is not in the
          city, they will be forwarded to him immediately by mail,

          <p>In ordering papers, be careful to write the names of

Produced by Joshua Hutchinson, Steve Schulze and PG Distributed Proofreaders

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use & Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
