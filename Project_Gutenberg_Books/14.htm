      <p style="font-weight: bold;">PROCLAMATION.</p>
      </center>
      <p><b>The Murder of Mr. Benjamin Nathan.</b></p>
      <p>The widow having determined to increase the rewards heretofore
offered by me (in my proclamation of July 29), and no result having yet
been obtained, and suggestions having been made that the rewards were
not sufficiently distributive or specific, the offers in the previous
proclamation are hereby superseded by the following:</p>
      <p>A REWARD of $30,000 will be paid for the arrest and conviction
of the murderer of BENJAMIN NATHAN, who was killed in his house, No. 12
West Twenty-third Street, New York, on the morning of Friday, July 29.</p>
      <p>A REWARD of $1,000 will be paid for the identification and
recovery of each and every one of the three Diamond Shirt Studs which
were taken from the clothing of the deceased on the night of the
murder. Two of the diamonds weighed, together, 1, 1/2, and 1/3, and
1/16 carats, and the other, a flat stone, showing nearly a surface of
one carat, weighed 3/4 and 1/32. All three were mounted in skeleton
settings, with spiral screws, but the color of the gold, setting of the
flat diamond was not so dark as the other two.</p>
      <p>A REWARD of $1,500 will be paid for the identification and
recovery of one of the watches, being the Gold anchor Hunting-case
Stem-winding Watch, No. 6657, 19 lines, or about two inches in
diameter, made by Ed. Perregaux; or for the Chain and Seals thereto
attached. The Chain is very massive, with square links, and carries a
Pendant Chain with two seals, one of them having the monogram "B.N.,"
cut thereon.</p>
      <p>A REWARD of $300 will be given for information leading to the
identification and recovery of an old-fashioned open-faced Gold Watch,
with gold dial, showing rays diverging from the center, and with raised
figures; believed to have been made by Tobias, and which was taken at
the same time as the above articles.</p>
      <p>A REWARD of $300 will be given for the recovery of a Gold
Medal of about the size of a silver dollar, and which bears an
inscription of presentation not precisely known, but believed to be
either "To Sampson Simpson, President of the Jews' Hospital," or, "To
Benjamin Nathan, President of the Jews' Hospital."</p>
      <p>A REWARD of $100 will be given for full and complete detailed
information descriptive of this medal, which may be useful in securing
its recovery.</p>
      <p>A REWARD of $1,000 will be given for information leading to
the identification of the instrument used in committing the murder,
which is known as a "dog" or clamp, and is a piece of wrought iron
about sixteen inches long, turned up for about an inch at each end, and
sharp; such as is used by ship-carpenters, or post-trimmers,
ladder-makers, pump-makers, sawyers, or by iron-moulders to clamp their
flasks.</p>
      <p>A REWARD of $800 will be given to the man who, on the morning
of the murder, was seen to ascend the steps and pick up a piece of
paper lying there, and then walk away with it, if he will come forward
and produce it.</p>
      <p>Any information bearing upon the case may be sent to the
Mayor, John Jourdan, Superintendent of Police City of New York; or to
James J. Kelso, Chief Detective Officer.</p>
      <p>A. OAKEY HALL, MAYOR.</p>
      <p>The foregoing rewards are offered by the request of, and are
guaranteed by me.</p>
      <p>Signed, EMILY G. NATHAN,<br>
Widow of B. NATHAN.</p>
      <p>The following reward has also been offered by the New York
Stock Exchange:</p>
      <p>$10,000&#8212;The New York Stock Exchange offers a reward of Ten
Thousand Dollars for the arrest and conviction of the murderer or
murderers of Benjamin Nathan, late a member of said Exchange, who was
killed on the night of July 28, 1870, at his house in Twenty-third
street, New York City.</p>

      <p>AN ADAPTATION.</p>
      <p>BY ORPHEUS C. KERR.</p>
      <p>CHAPTER XV.</p>
      <p>"SPOTTED."</p>
      <p>When the bell of St. Cow's began ringing for Ritualistic
morning-service, with a sound as of some incontinently rambling dun
spinster of the lacteal herd&#8212;now near at hand in cracked dissonance, as
the wind blows hither; now afar, in tinkling distance, as the wind
blows hence&#8212;MONTGOMERY PENDRAGON was several miles away from
Bumsteadville upon his walking-match, with head already bumped like a
pineapple, and face curiously swelled, from amateur practice with the
Indian Club. Being by that time cold enough for breakfast, and willing
to try the virtues of some soothing application to his right eye,
which, from a bruise just below it, was nearly closed, the badly banged
young man suspended his murderous calisthenics at the door of a rustic
hotel, and there entered to secure a wayside meal.</p>
      <p>The American country "hotel," or half-way house, is, perhaps,
one of the most depressing fictions ever encountered by
stage-passenger, or pedestrian afield: and depends so exclusively upon
the imagination for any earthly distinction from the retired and
neglected private hiding-place of some decayed and morbid agricultural
family, that only the conventional swing sign-board before the door
saves the cognizant mind from a painfully dense confusion. Smelling
about equally of eternal wash-day, casual cow-shed, and passing
feather-bed, it sustains a lank, middle-aged, gristly man to come out
at the same hour every day and grunt unintelligibly at the
stage-driver, an expressionless boy in a bandless straw-hat and no
shoes to stare blankly from the doorway at the same old pole-horse he
has mechanically thus inspected from infancy, and one speckled hen of
mature years to poise observingly on single leg at the head of the
shapeless black dog asleep at the sunny end of the low wooden stoop. It
is the one rural spot on earth where a call for fresh eggs evokes
remonstrative and chronic denial; where chickens for dinner are sternly
discredited as mere freaks of legendary romance, and an order for a
glass of new milk is incredulously answered by a tumblerful of water
which tastes of whitewash-brush. Whosoever sleeps there of a night
shall be crowded by walls which rub off into a faint feather-bed of the
flavor and consistency of geese used whole, and have for his feverish
breakfast in the morning a version of broiled ham as racy of attic-salt
as the rasher of BACON'S essays. And to him who pays his bill there,
ere he straggles weakly forth to repair his shattered health by
frenzied flight, shall be given in change such hoary ten-cent shreds of
former postal currency as he has not hitherto deemed credible, sticking
together in inextricable conglomeration by such fragments of
fish-scales as he never before believed could be gathered by handled
small-money from palms not sufficiently washed after piscatorial
diversion.</p>
      <p>It was in at a country hotel, then, that the young Southern
pedestrian turned for temporary rest and a meal, and pitiless was the
cross-examination instituted by the inevitable lank, middle-aged
gristly man, before he could reconcile it with his duty as a cautious
public character to reveal the treasures of the larder. Those bumps on
the head, that swollen eye, and nose, came&#8212;did they?&#8212;from swinging this
here club for exercise. Well, he wanted to know, now! People generally
used two of the clubs at once&#8212;did they?&#8212;but one was enough for a
beginner. Well, he <i>wanted</i> to know, now! Could he supply a
couple of poached eggs and a cup of milk? No, young man; but a slice of
corned pork and a bowl of tea were within the resources of the
establishment.</p>
      <p>When at length upon the road again, the bruised youth resolved
to follow a cattle-track "across lots," for the greater space in which
to exercise with his Indian club as he walked. Like any other novice in
the practice, he could not divest his mind of the impression, that the
frightful thumps he continually received, in twirling the merciless
thing around and behind his devoted head, were due to some kind of
crowding influence from the boundaries on either side the way, and it
was to gain relief from such damaging contraction of area that he left
the highway for the wider wintry fields. Going onward in these latter
at an irregular pace; sometimes momentarily stunned into a rangy
stagger by a sounding blow on the cerebrum or the cerebellum; and,
again, irritated almost to a run by contusion of shoulder-blade or
funny-bone; he finally became aware that two men were following him
through the lots, and that with a closeness of attention indicating
more than common interest. To the perception of his keenly sensitive
Southern nature they at once became ribald Yankee vandals, hoping for
unseemly amusement from the detection of some awkwardness in the
Indian-club-play of a defeated but not conquered Southern Gentleman;
and, in the haughty sectional pride of his contemptuous soul, he
indignantly determined to show not the least consciousness of their
disrespectful observation. Twirling the club around and around his
battered head with increasing velocity, he smiled scornfully to
himself, nor deigned a single backward glance at the one of his two
followers who approached more rapidly than the other. He heard the
hindermost say to the foremost, "Leave him alone, I tell you, and he'll
knock himself down in a minute," and, in a passionately reckless effort
of sheer bravado to catch the club from one hand with the other while
it yet circled swiftly over his skull, he accidentally brought the
ungovernable weapon into tremendous contact with the top of his head,
and dashed himself violently to the earth.</p>
      <p>"Didn't I tell you he'd do it?" cried the hindermost of the
two strangers, coming up; while the other coolly seated himself upon
the prostrated victim. "These here Indian clubs always throw a man if
he ain't got muscle in his arms; and this here little Chivalry has got
arms like a couple of canes."</p>
      <p>"Arise from me instantly, fellow. You're sitting upon my
breast-pin," exclaimed MONTGOMERY to the person sitting upon him.</p>
      <p>They suffered him to regain his feet, which he did with
extreme hauteur, and surveyed his bumped head and swollen countenance
with undisguised wonder.</p>
      <p>"How dare you treat a Southerner in this way?" continued the
young man, his head aching inexpressibly. "I thought the war was over
long ago. If money is your object, seek out a citizen of some other
section than mine; for the South is out of funds just now, owing to the
military outrages of Northern scorpions."</p>
      <p>"We're constables, Mr. PENDRAGON," was the reply, "and it is
our duty to take you back to the main road, where a couple of your
friends are waiting for you."</p>
      <p>Staring from one to the other in speechless wonder at what
this fresh outrage upon the down-trodden South could mean, MONTGOMERY
allowed them to replace his Indian club in his hand, and conduct him
back to the public road; where, to his increased bewilderment, he found
Gospeler SIMPSON and the Ritualistic organist.</p>
      <p>"What is the matter, gentlemen?" he asked, in great agitation:
"must I take the oath of Loyalty; or am I required by Yankee
philanthropy to marry a negress?"</p>
      <p>At the sound of his voice, Mr. BUMSTEAD left the shoulder of
Mr. SIMPSON, upon which he had been leaning with great weight, and,
coming forward in three long skips, deliberately wound his right hand
in the speaker's neck-tie.</p>
      <p>"Where are those nephews&#8212;where's that umbrella?" demanded the
organist, with considerable ferocity.</p>
      <p>"Nephews!&#8212;umbrella!" gasped the other.</p>
      <p>"The EDWINS&#8212;bone handle," explained Mr. BUMSTEAD, lurching
towards his captive.</p>
      <p>"Mr. MONTGOMERY," interposed the Gospeler, sadly, Mr. DROOD
went out with you last night, late, from his estimable uncle's
lodgings, and has not been seen since. Where is he?"</p>
      <p>"He went back into the house again, sir, after I had walked
him up and down the road a few times."</p>
      <p>"Well, then, where's that umbrella?" roared the organist, who
seemed quite beside himself with grief and excitement.</p>
      <p>"Mr. BUMSTEAD, pray be more calm," implored the Reverend
OCTAVIUS.</p>
      <p>"Mr. MONTGOMERY, this agitated gentleman's nephew has been
mysteriously missing ever since he went out with you at midnight: also
an alpaca umbrella."</p>
      <p>"Upon my honor, I know nothing of either," ejaculated the
unhappy Southerner.</p>
      <p>Mr. BUMSTEAD, still holding him by the neck-tie, cast a fiery
and unsettled glance around at nothing in particular; then ground his
teeth audibly, and scowled.</p>
      <p>"My boy's missing!" he said, hissingly.&#8212;"Y'understand?&#8212;he's
missing.&#8212;I must insist upon searching the prisoner."</p>
      <p>In the presence of Gospeler and constables, and loftily
regardless alike of their startled wonder and the young man's protests,
the maddened uncle of the lost DROOD deliberately examined all the
captive's pockets in succession. In one of them was a penknife, which,
after thoughtfully trying it upon his pink nails, he abstractedly
placed in his own pocket. Searching next the overwhelmed Southerner's
travelling-satchel, he found in it an apple, which he first eyed with
marked suspicion, and then bit largely into, as though half expecting
to find in it some traces of his nephew.</p>
      <p>"I'll keep this suspicious fruit," he remarked, with a hollow
laugh; and, bearing unreservedly upon the nearer arm of the hapless
MONTGOMERY, and eating audibly as he surged onward, he started on the
return march for Bumsteadville.</p>
      <p>Not a word more was spoken until, after a cool Christmas
stroll of about eight and a quarter miles, the whole party stood before
Judge SWEENEY in the house of the latter. There, when the story had
been sorrowfully repeated by the Gospeler, Mr. BUMSTEAD exhibited the
core of the apple, and tickled the magistrate almost into hysterics by
whispering very closely in his ear, that it was a core curiously
similar to that of the last apple eaten by his nephew; and, having been
found in an apple from the prisoner's satchel, might be useful in
evidence. Judge SWEENEY wished to know if Mr. PENDRAGON had any
political relations, or could influence any votes? and, upon being
answered in the negative, eyed the young man sternly, and said that
appearances were decidedly against him. He could not exactly commit him
to jail without accusation, although the apple-core and his political
unimportance subjected him to grave suspicion: but he should hold the
Gospeler responsible for the youth's appearance at any time when his
presence should be required. Mr. BUMSTEAD, whose eyes were becoming
very glassy, then suggested that a handbill should be at once printed
and circulated, to the effect that there had been Lost, or Stolen, two
Black Alpaca Nephews, about 5 feet 8 inches high, with a bone handle,
light eyes and hair, and whalebone ribs; and that if the said EDWIN
would return, with a brass ferule slightly worn, the finder should
receive earnest thanks, and be seen safely to his home by J. BUMSTEAD.
Mr. Gospeler SIMPSON and Judge SWEENEY agreed that a handbill should be
issued: but thought it might confuse the public mind if the missing
nephew and the lost umbrella were not kept separate.</p>
      <p>"Has either 'f you gen'l'men ever been 'n Uncle?" asked the
Ritualistic organist, with dark intensity.</p>
      <p>They shook their heads.</p>
      <p>"<i>Then,</i>" said Mr. BUMSTEAD, with great force,&#8212;"THEN,
gen'l'men, you-knownor-wahritis-to-lose-'n-umbrella!"</p>
      <p>Before they could decide in their weaker minds what the
immediate connection was, he had left them, at a sharp slant, in great
intellectual disturbance, and was passing out through the entry-way
with both his hands against the wall.</p>
      <p>Early next morning, while young Mr. PENDRAGON was locked in
his room, startled and wretched, the inconsolable uncle of EDWIN DROOD
was energetically ransacking every part of Bumsteadville for the
missing man. House after house he visited, like some unholy inspector:
peering up chimneys, prodding under carpets, and staying a long time in
cellars where there was cider. Not a bit of paper or cloth blew along
the turnpike but he eagerly picked it up, searched in it with the most
anxious care, and finally placed it in his hat. Going to the Pond, with
a borrowed hatchet, he cut a bole in the thick ice, lost the hatchet,
and, after bathing his head in the water, declared that his alpaca
nephew was not there. Finding an antique flask in one of his pockets,
he gradually removed all the liquid contents therefrom with a tubular
straw, but still could discern no traces of EDWIN DROOD. All the
live-long day he prosecuted his researches, to the great discomposure
of the populace: and, with whitewash all over the back of his coat, and
very dingy hands, had just seated himself at his own fireside in the
evening, when Mr. DIBBLE came in.</p>
      <p>"This is a strange disappearance," said Mr. DIBBLE.</p>
      <p>"And it was good as new," groaned the organist, with but one
eye open.</p>
      <p>"Almost new!&#8212;<i>what</i> was?"</p>
      <p>"Th'umbrella."</p>
      <p>"Mr. BUMSTEAD," returned the old man, coldly, "I am not
talking of an umbrella, but of Mr. EDWIN."</p>
      <p>"Yesh, I know," said the uncle. "Awright. I'm li'lle sleepy;
tha'sall."</p>
      <p>"I've just seen my ward, Mr. BUMSTEAD."</p>
      <p>"'She puerwell, shir?"</p>
      <p>"She is <i>not</i> pretty well. Nor is Miss PENDRAGON."</p>
      <p> "I'm vahr' sorry," said Mr. BUMSTEAD, just audibly.</p>
      <p>"Miss PENDRAGON scorns the thought of any blame for her
brother," continued Mr. DIBBLE, eyeing the fire.</p>
      <p>"It had a bun-bone handle," muttered the other, dreamily.
Then, with a momentary brightening&#8212;"'scuse me, shir: whah'll y'take?"</p>
      <p>"Nothing, sir!" was the sharp response. "I'm not at all
thirsty. But there is something more to tell you. At the last meeting
of my ward and your nephew&#8212;just before your dinner here,&#8212;they concluded
to break their engagement of marriage, for certain good reasons, and
thenceforth be only brother and sister to each other."</p>
      <p>Starting forward in his chair, with partially opened eyes, the
white-washed and dingy Mr. BUMSTEAD managed to get off his hat,
covering himself with a bandanna handkerchief and innumerable old
pieces of paper and cloth, as he did so, from head to foot; made a
feeble effort to throw it at the aged lawyer; and then, chair and all,
tumbled forward with a crash to the rug, where he lay in a refreshing
sleep.</p>

      <p><b>CHINCAPIN AT LONG BRANCH.</b></p>
      <p>A QUAKER friend of mine once observed that he loved the Ocean
for its Broad Brim. So do I, but not for that alone. I am partial to it
on account of the somewhat extensive facilities it affords for Sea
Bathing. Learning to swim, by the way, was my principal Elementary
study. I have just returned from taking a plunge in company with many
other distinguished persons. How it cools one to rush into the "Boiling
Surf." How refreshing to dive Below the Billow. I don't think I could
ever have a Surfeit of the Surf, I am so fond of it. Oh! the Sea! the
Sea! with its darkly, deeply cerulean&#8212;but stop! I am getting out of my
depth. Would that I were a poet, that I&#8212;But I ain't, so what's the use?</p>
      <p>As I sat on the verandah of the ------ Hotel the other
morning, gazing on the broad expanse of Ocean and wiping the
perspiration which trickled from my lofty brow, (the thermometer marked
90 degrees,) I could not help recalling the beautifully appropriate
lines of the celebrated bard:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"When
the sun's perpendicular rays</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Begin to illumine the Sea,</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fishies exclaim in amaze</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">'Confound it! how hot it will
be!'"</span> </div>
      <p>What a pity that the Bathing here has a drawback. I refer, of
course, to the Under Tow, which has caused some Untoward accidents.
Those who have experienced it, say it is impossible to keep your Feet
when caught by the Under Tow. Presence of mind is indispensable in such
a case, but, unfortunately, timid swimmers are too apt to lose their
Heads as well as their feet. Some of the lady visitors are Beautiful
Swimmers, and their Divers Charms excite universal admiration. Many of
these fair Amphitrites are so constantly in or on the water that it
would hardly be a Fib to call them Amphibious. Their husbands and
brothers are, I regret to say, not so much On the Water, preferring
something a trifle stronger semi-occasionally, if not oftener.</p>
      <p>You know what a popular amusement crabbing is here. I seldom
indulge in it myself, as I have bad luck, which makes me Crabbed.</p>
      <p>Our "distinguished guests," as JENKINS would say, are very
numerous, and it is truly an edifying sight to see judges, legislators,
eminent politicians, and other "Heads of the People" bobbing about in
the water together.</p>
      <p>Some folks don't seem to care what they spend when they come
here, and no sooner arrive at the Branch than they Branch out into all
sorts of extravagance. There is some superb horseflesh here just now,
and the fastest nags may be seen doing their Level best on the Smooth
Beach. The Race Track, Grand Stand, &amp;c., are all that the vivid
fancy of a PUNCHINELLO can paint them. The bathing costumes! who can do
justice to them and their lovely wearers? Some time ago, (as I am
informed,) a lady made her appearance on the beach as a Nereid. Did you
Ne'er read of the Nereids, Mr. PUNCHINELLO? If you have, you are aware
that they were the Sea Nymphs of the Ancients, in other words the Old
Maids of the Sea, who never got married, and frequently played Scaly
tricks on Mariners. The Nereid referred to was arrayed in pea green and
spangles, with green tresses, which is very well known to be the
correct costume of a mermaid of antiquity, copied from the latest Paris
fashions. This Spritely lady was, however, unprovided with a tail,
which was Unmermaidenlike in the Extreme.</p>
      <p>You know how brilliant the Hops are, so I will Skip them. One
thing, however, is worth noting. At some of the Hotels they have a
Spread on the carpet before the dancing begins, as well as a supper
afterwards. The excellent music of the Hotel bands is Instrumental in
drawing crowds of listeners to the Ball rooms. Some Chinese Jugglers
gave an entertainment here the other evening, but I didn't go, not
being in the Juggler Vein. Yours Reverentially,</p>

      <p><b>THE POEMS OF THE CRADLE.</b></p>
      <p>CANTO IV.</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little
JACK HORNER</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sat in a corner.</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Eating a Christmas Pie:</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">He put in his thumb</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pulled out a plum,</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And said, "What a brave boy am
I."</span> </div>
      <p>In Canto I, I have shown the varied emotions which seized the
tender soul of Old Mother HUBBARD'S Dog. Emotions so fierce in their
sorrow, that they left not a single wiggle in his tail: his hopes were
crushed, his expectations ruined. In Canto II I have pictured the
musical propensities of the genus <i>Cat</i>, the wandering vagaries
of the moon-dane cow, the purp's withering contempt thereat, and the
frisky evolutions of the dish which rolled off on its ear. In Canto III
I have portrayed the "tender passion" and its melancholy result on the
hill-side&#8212;a fitting illustration of the fact that the course of true
love never did run smooth, especially if there were big rocks to knock
one's toes against. And now, in Canto IV, I am about to portray
childish innocence in the pursuit of bliss.</p>
      <p>All things are graded, with the trifling exception of many of
our streets. But who cares about this grade of bliss? I don't, and I am
sure the poet didn't when he sang the lines at the head of this
chapter. Bliss is graded. The old man in Wall street, with white hair
and white necktie, and smooth polished tongue, has his degree of bliss
when he is engaged in throwing stones at the Apes in the tree-top, that
they may return the throw with gold cocoa-nuts. The young lady has her
degree of bliss when her waist is entwined by "Dear CHAWLES," who
soothes her troubled spirit with the tender melody of "Red as a beet is
she,"&#8212; alluding to her would-be rival. The nice young man has his
degree of bliss when he chews a tooth-pick&#8212;poor goose! (not the nice
young man, but the fowl which gave the quill,)&#8212;and is given a smile by
a dark-eyed female in a passing stage.</p>
      <p>And Infantdom has&#8212;But our poet beautifully illustrates this in
the stanzas we have quoted.</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Little
JACK HORNER,"</span> </div>
      <p>says he, with the easy grace of one perfectly familiar with
the subject he is to treat; neither frightened at its immensity, nor
putting himself in the way of a dilemma by stopping to examine details.
Little JACK was the poet's pet because he was the afflicted one of the
household, and poets know full well how to sympathize with affliction.
Perhaps JACK sat down to dinner next to cross-eyed SUSAN ANN, "by
Brother BILL'S gal," and perhaps JACK'S nose was tickled by a little
blue-bottle, and that he sneezed right into her soup-plate; and then he
was hurried from the table for blowing a fly into SUSAN ANN'S soup! He
would lose his dinner. His napkin would miss its accustomed wash!</p>
      <p>"Shall it be thus? No!" says the poet. "Dry your tears, little
JACK, go to the well-stocked pantry, my boy, and get something to eat.
The jury will not convict you of stealing, for their verdict will be
that you did the deed in self-defence." And he did&#8212;go to the closet,
and&#8212;</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Sat
in the corner,</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eating a Christmas Pie."</span> </div>
      <p>See the smiles as they wreathe themselves on his chubby
countenance. How little JACK looks at the pie! how he turns it round
and round to find the best spot whereon to begin the attack! How he
smacks his lips, and thinks how nice it would be if he <i>could</i>
wish to give SUSAN ANN a taste! But he can't.</p>
      <p>Suddenly an idea strikes JACK. He has heard Uncle TOM talk of
a big war between Frawnce and Proossia, and all about the soldiers and
the cannon, and the big noises. Little JACK will make war on the pie.
He will be Frawnce, the pie will be Proossia. He sets it squarely
before him on the floor; rolls up his sleeves, may be; his eyes sparkle
with determination; he finds the most vulnerable spot in the crust; he
makes one bold dive with his thumb, it goes down, down down, crushing
everything before it; it feels something; renewed vigor flows through
JACK'S veins, and gives him new strength for the attack; victory crowns
him; and, in the words of the poet,</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He
pulled out a plum,</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And said, 'What a brave boy am
I.'"</span> </div>
      <p>&#8212;Now he is happy. He has realized his fondest hopes. The
blue-bottle has no tickle for him now. He was Frawnce and he has licked
Proossia. There is nothing left but the plate, and his teeth are not
hard enough for that.</p>

      <p>And now comes to light another divorce case in Chicago. Mrs.

is anything in a name, no one will gainsay the observation that if
hugging has lost its charm, Mrs. HUGG is the last person to make a fuss

and it is contrary to public policy and good morals that her plea of

      <p>In France they do not wait for the completion of the years of
adolescence to dub a scion of the royal family with the title of "man."
The Prince Imperial, prior to his departure for the wars, was presented
at Court as the "first gentleman" of France. For a youth of fourteen he
is said to have gone through the trying ceremonies with great credit
until directed by his mamma to dance with a venerable female of noble
blood, just as he was about to lend a beautiful American miss through
the mazes of a Schottische. The son of his father took one glance at
the ancient dame, and one at the lovely creature beside him, and then
set up a right royal blubber of disappointment.</p>
      <p>"Remember, my son," said EUGENIE, "you are a man now, and men
never cry."</p>
      <p>"Oh! mamma," sighed the afflicted Prince, "let me be a boy

      <p><b>THE WATERING PLACES.</b></p>
      <p>Punchinello's Vacations.</p>
      <p>It was hot when Mr. PUNCHINELLO started for Niagara. So hot
that no allusions to Fahrenheit would give an idea of the tremendous
preponderance of caloric in the atmosphere. The trip was full of
discomforts, and there was great danger, at one time, that the train
would arrive at Niagara with a load of desiccated bodies. Of course the
water all boiled away in the engine-tanks, causing endless stoppages;
and of course the hot sun, pouring directly upon the roof of the cars,
caused the boards thereof to curl up and twist about in such fantastic
fashion, that they afforded no protection whatever to the passengers,
who were obliged to resort to sunshades and umbrellas, or get under the
seats. Added to this were the facts that the ice-water in the coolers
scalded the mouth; the brass-work on the seats blistered the hands; and
the empty stoves, almost red-hot from their exposure to the sun,
superheated the cars to a degree that was maddening. Added to these was
the fact that the intense heat expanded the rails until they were
several miles longer than usual, and thus the passengers suffered the
tortures of the transit for an increased length of time.</p>
      <p>When, at last, Mr. P. was conveyed, in a stifling hack, (the
fare had risen, under the unusual circumstances, about one hundred and
ten degrees,) to a stifling little room under the hot roof of an hotel
exposed to the sun on every side, and had taken an extempore Russian
bath while changing his linen, and had partaken of a hot dinner, he
might have been excused for saying that he would like to cool off a
little.</p>
      <p>Inquiring if there was any stream of water convenient, he was
directed to the river Niagara, which runs hard by the hotel.</p>
      <p>Reaching the banks of the river, Mr. P. was very much pleased
by the prospect. There is a considerable depression in the bed of the
stream at one point, and the water runs over the rocks quite rapidly,
carrying with it such leaves, twigs, steamboats or other objects that
may be floating upon its surface.</p>
      <img src="images/06a.jpg" align="left" alt="">
      <p>Mr. P. immediately perceived the advantages of this condition
of things to a a gentleman suffering from the heat, and procuring a
boat, he rowed close to the foot of a cascade formed by the inclination
in the bed of the river, and throwing out his anchor, revelled in the
luxury of the cool spray and the refreshing sound of the rushing water.</p>
      <p>Does not this look cool?</p>
      <p>When sufficiently refreshed, Mr. P. rowed to shore, feeling
like another man. With the greatest confidence in its merits, he
recommends his plan to those who may be suffering from the summer heat.</p>
      <p>After breakfast the next morning, Mr. P. set out to see what
he could see. He did not engage the services of any hackman or
professional guide.</p>
      <p>He had heard of their extortions, and determined to submit to
nothing of the kind. He intended relying entirely upon himself. He
walked some distance without meeting with any of the places of interest
of which he had heard so much.</p>
      <p>Meeting at length with a respectable elderly gentleman, Mr. P.
inquired of him the way to the Cave of the Winds.</p>
      <img src="images/06b.jpg" align="right" alt="">
      <p>"The Cave of the Winds? Ah!" said this worthy person. "You
turn to your left here, sir&#8212;ah! and then you keep on for about&#8212;ah! half
a mile, and you will&#8212;ah! see a gate&#8212;ah! Behind that is a man and the
cave&#8212;ah!"</p>
      <p>Mr. P. thanked him and was proceeding on his way, when the
worthy citizen touched him on the arm, saying:</p>
      <p>"Twenty-one dollars, if you please, sir."</p>
      <p>"Twenty-one dev----developments!" cried Mr. P; "Why, what do
you mean?"</p>
      <p>"Information, sir; fifty cents a word; forty-two words;
twenty-one dollars."</p>
      <p>It must not be supposed that Mr. P. submitted tamely to this
outrage, but after a long dispute, it was agreed to refer the matter to
the arbitration of three of the principal citizens. They promptly
decided that the charge was just and must be paid, but, owing to Mr.
P.'s earnest protestations, they agreed to throw out the "ahs," as
being of doubtful value as information. The sum thus saved to Mr. P.
exactly paid for drinks for the party.</p>
      <p>Mr. P. now very sensibly concluded that it was about time to
leave, if his editors, his printers, and the employ&#233;s in his
pun-factory were to expect any pay that week, and so he set out for
home in the evening, taking a shortcut by the way of Montreal.</p>
      <p>He thought that a day might be very profitably spent here,
especially if he could fall in with any of the French-Canadians, of
whose peculiarities he had heard so much. The study of human nature was
always Mr. P.'s particular forte.</p>
      <p>On the morning of his arrival, Mr. P. met, in the dining-room
of the hotel, a gentleman who was unmistakably a Frenchman, and being
in Canada, was probably Canadian. As they were sitting together at the
table, Mr. P., having mentally rubbed up his knowledge of the French
language, addressed his companion thus:</p>
      <p>"<i>Avez-vous le chapeau de mon frere?</i>"</p>
      <p>The gentleman thus politely addressed, bowed, smiled, and
after a little hesitation answered:</p>
      <p>"<i>Non, Monsieur; mais j&agrave;i le fromage de votre soeur.</i>"</p>
      <p>"<i>Eh bien</i>" said Mr. P., as he scratched his head for a
moment. "<i>Otez vous vos souliers et vos bas?</i>"</p>
      <p>The other answered promptly, "<i>Je n'ote ni les uns ni les
autres.</i>"</p>
      <p>"<i>Votre p&egrave;re,</i>" remarked Mr. P., "<i>a-t-il la
chandelle de votre oncle?</i>"</p>
      <p>His companion remained silent for a minute or two, and then he
said:</p>
      <p>"I forget the French of the answer to that, but I know the
English of it; it is 'no, sir, but he has the
apples-of-the-ground-of-sugar of my mother-in-law.'"</p>
      <p>When Mr. P. discovered, after a little conversation in the
vernacular, that his companion was a New York dry-goods clerk, he gave
up the study of the French-Canadian character and went on with his
breakfast.</p>
      <p>When he went out into the streets to see the lions of the city
he was delighted to meet with some old friends. In company with them he
visited the Government House; the Cathedral; the Statue of NELSON; the
VICTORIA bridge; and everything else of interest in the place. But
nothing was so delightful to him as the faces of these old friends,
from whom he had been separated so long.</p>

      <p>The sympathy exhibited by the <i>Sun</i> reporters and
editors for the unhappy victim of Ogre Tammany is particularly touching.</p>
      <p>Association with the Wickedest Man in New York, the Honorable
JOHN ALLEN, <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of the Reverend OLIVER DYER,
has evidently demoralized the pure beings who control the immaculate
sheet known as the <i>Sun</i>, whose putrescent light "shines for all."</p>
      <p>These panders to the depraved taste of a depraved portion of
the community, may exult in the spectacle presented in the City of New
York on Sunday, the 7th inst., but is it not a sorrowful thing in a
so-called Christian land to see a murderer borne with triumph to his
grave, while pseudo philanthropists deck his bier with flowers, and
deliberately charge a great political party with having hunted the
wretched man to his death?</p>
      <p>Was there no nobler game worth the killing by Tammany? Was
there not a "stag of Ten" to be found, to be struck, if party
necessities required it? Would OAKEY HALL and PETER B. SWEENY put such
a slight upon these bastard allies of the O'BRIENS and MORRISSEYS whose
columns are open to the highest bidder, and whose lips reek venom while
their hands are ever ready to strike a victim in the back, as to pass
them by while they were on the war-path?</p>
      <p>But hold&#8212;perhaps we have a clue to this singular conduct of
the Tammany warriors. They may have foreseen how apt the sweet people
are to confer immortality upon those whose death becomes them better
than their life, and therefore wisely forebore to disturb those
blissful with murderers and felons which seem to bind the Satellites of
the <i>Sun</i> and the denizens of the Tombs together.</p>

      <p>A LITTLE Fourth-of-Julyer in Pittsburgh, going along with his
mouth open, (after the manner of boys), caught a fire-cracker therein,
just as the cracker was going off. He had often had crackers in his
mouth, but preceding ones had proved nourishing and non-explosive;
whereas, this cracker was quite the reverse. As a consequence, the boy
has lost his voice, but (what is curious, certainly,) is otherwise all
sound.</p>
      <p>Were we certain that heaving a fire-cracker into an open mouth
would always produce such a result, we should certainly hire some one
to shut up the noisier of our public nuisances&#8212;such as G.F. TRAIN, and
several members of Congress. This could be easily done, as their mouths
are always open, and usually are very large ones. We invite proposals
from boys, relating to next season's operations.</p>

      <p>Such a circumstance may be fallen upon without going so far as
Africa to seek for it. JOHN ALLEN, of Water Street, was, once upon a
time, the Zulu Kaffir of DANA of the <i>Sun</i> and his fascinating
Satellite, OLIVER DYER.<p>
      <p>The ways of JOHN ALLEN were very wicked when
these pious missionaries threw themselves upon his trail, and tried to
convert him. Perhaps the reformatory effort was well meant; but, alas!
for the feebleness of all human arrangements&#8212;JOHN ALLEN remains the
reprobate he was, while he to his flock has brought DANA, the <i>Sun</i>
man, and DYER, the Satellite man, converts to the Allenian theory that
money made from dirt is the only healthful stimulant to virtuous toil.</p>
      <p>And so it was that DANA the devout, and DYER the saintly, went
forth to convert the Zulu Kaffir of Water Street, and the Z. F.
converted them.</p>

      <p>Mr. Punchinello: As the acknowledged redresser of American
wrongs and the enemy of public nuisances, we beg your attention to a
vice which seems to be upon the increase, and which grows in strength
with what it feeds upon. As the vice in question appears to be upon the
increase, and to fascinate its victims by the allurements of the
excitement, we consider it worthy of PUNCHINELLO'S lance, or, in other
words, of being transfixed upon PUNCHINELLO'S quill.</p>
      <p>We refer to the loafing which invariably takes place upon the
occasion of the relaying of the wooden pavement. I say wooden more
particularly, inasmuch as new fangled varieties of pavement, such as
Concrete, Nicholson, etc., although they have their day, cannot be said
to compete for a moment in public regard with the good old fashioned
kind first described.</p>
      <p>Of all the causes that arrest public attention, surely this
laying of wooden pavement is the most enduring and effectual.</p>
      <p>People of every grade and degree make a dead halt as they
approach this centre of interest, and at once settle down for a
prolonged inspection of the works before them. It is true that
everybody has seen the same thing one hundred and fifty times, but this
description of indulgence appears to grow by what it feeds upon, and
the fascinated victim watches the operation of the workers with a
gratification which knows no abatement. The usual formula gone through
upon these occasions is as follows:</p>
      <p>Citizen approaches the scene of interest, and sees crowds of
spectators upon each side; he glances at the workmen, and, after taking
stock of both them and the overseer, proceeds to read the opinion of
his fellows in their faces, after which he settles down in right
earnest with his hands in his pockets for a prolonged stare. This
latter may continue for periods varying from ten minutes to an hour and
three quarters, according to inclination or opportunity.</p>
      <p>If the spectator is a man of business, it is just possible
that he may content himself with measuring the size of the blocks with
his eye, and then pass on, content to know that he, as one out of many
taxpayers, is getting the value of what they are called on to pay for.
But with the mass of the onlookers, the pouring of the hot pitch into
the gravelled interstices is watched with a satisfaction ever new, like
that bestowed in the pantomime upon the application by the clown of the
red-hot poker.</p>
      <p>There is also the pleasure of seeing others at hard work, and
the indulgence of everybody's belief (which is common to all present,)
that he or she could suggest an improvement upon the work proceeding,
and the manner of doing it. Then they look at each other once more and
depart contented.</p>
      <p>Upon a moderate calculation, the amount of time devoted by
human beings to this amusing study, in the City of New York, amounts to
2,450,000 hours per annum.</p>

      <p><b>ENGLAND'S QUANDARY.</b></p>
      <p>Conjecture and expectancy, O PUNCHINELLO! have been the order
of the day in this European turmoil, with regard to the position of
what are called neutral Powers. People have been looking at England
with much curiosity to see what she really does intend. With the
facilities which our <i>special wire</i> affords, I am enabled to
report a highly interesting soliloquy delivered by the Rt. Hon. W. E.
GLADSTONE, to his bed-post, at his home in Spring Gardens, London,
after a hot night's debate at St. STEPHEN'S. Our reporter concealed
himself in the key-hole and took <i>verbatim</i> notes. As in the case
of the speeches delivered by the rival monarchs to their armies, which
you published a week in advance of the speeches themselves, the
following can be relied on:</p>
      <p>"I'm tired of answering questions. Let me think awhile. Is war
the only alternative? They blame me for not talking out. Fools, they
don't know where they stand. At home and abroad, difficulty. Our
workmen emigrating; the Irish irreconcilable, (curse that word!)
nothing cheerful that side.</p>
      <p>"France can rock <i>her</i> irreconcilables to sleep to the
war lullaby of that man we have so trusted only to betray us; <i>our</i>
irreconcilables only wait for war to side with our enemy. Prussia,
grasping bull-dog as she is, makes capital out of it, and calls us to
her side, while our stupid people burn with a Prussian fever, which may
turn to a plague to-morrow.</p>
      <p>"Is the Prussian whom we have helped to humble to be our only
ally? Then must we write ourselves down asses in Constantinople.</p>
      <p>"If we had some other head besides weather-cock expediency.
France has an Emperor, Prussia a King to lead them; we have a Queen who
takes walks in the Isle of Wight; and her son&#8212;bah! a <i>rou&eacute;</i>
about town. Their marriage alliances are drag-chains, not bonds of
love. Denmark does not forget our treachery in '65. Holland is afraid
of France. We are safe from America yet. They are too much afraid of
the German vote, thank Heaven, to side with France, but "Alabama" is
her watchword, and she only waits to strangle us. LAFAYETTE and the
Hessians are only memories, they have no votes. Ah! it was a mistake to
sympathize with the South.</p>
      <p>"Our statesmen&#8212;Heaven save the mark!&#8212;are our worst enemies.
D'ISRAELI, the Jew, doubles our difficulty by showing our weakness. He
would play the part of PITT without his brains or his chances. Then we
led, now we are dragged at the tail. We may sign treaties, but we
cannot write them. BRIGHT would be friendly with both; GRANVILLE with
neither, and thus each is offended. It is ridiculous, and the only
course left is to bluster about Belgium.</p>
      <p>"It must be the late dinner. There are all sorts of
threatening shadows around, and but one light; that is a war flame. Let
me sleep. To-morrow the gaping thousands will ask a sign. It may come,
but it shall be hoisted on the Rhine, and, helpless tide waiters, we
cannot tell from which side it shall come. Ah! 'Uneasy sits the man on
the ministerial bench,' as SHAKESPEARE would say to-day, for the crown
that he spoke of is an ornament in the tower."</p>

      <p>THE LEAVEN OF LEAVENWORTH. The great West has long been famous
for the loose, untrammelled freedom with which its inhabitants treat
everything and everybody. Breadth, no less than length, is a striking
feature of Western settlements, and that this element is conspicuous in
the journalism of those singular abodes, no less than in the social
life of their inhabitants, generally, is evidenced in the following
advertisement cut from "<i>The Times</i>"&#8212;a paper published at
Leavenworth, Kansas:</p>
      <p>"NOTICE TO DRIVERS OF FAST STOCK.&#8212;Hold your horses and do not
drive so fast. All gay and festive cusses caught driving faster than
ordinary gait in the city, will be brought before Judge Vaughan, for
instance--the fine is $20.</p>
      <p>H. A. ROBERTSON, City Marshal."</p>
      <p>The City Marshal of Leavenworth is clearly a pot-companion of
the first (whiskey and) water. He declines to address his
fellow-citizens in the commonplace terms usually recognised in more
prosaic communities. To adopt his own style of phraseology, ROBERTSON
is clearly a "gay and festive cuss." He is a specimen brick from
Kansas, and doubtless always carries one in his hat. The expression
"ordinary gait," as applied to driving in Kansas, where everybody owns
"fast stock," is rather equivocal in these quieter latitudes to be
sure, but we may guess that, at Leavenworth, a man who rides or drives
at a pace of twenty miles an hour, is liable, "for instance," to a fine
of $20, or just one dollar per mile. Kansas maybe a very nice place to
live in, for some people, but we would hardly recommend Mr. ROBERT
BONNER to emigrate thither, and so risk the probability of being
advertised as a "gay and festive cuss."</p>

      <p><b>SHIP AHOY!</b></p>
      <p>Of all public performers, there are none who "draw" better
than the gymnasts who risk their necks by attempting hazardous feats.
The fool who attaches himself by the heels to the car of an ascending
balloon is sure to have thousands of feeble-minded females waving
handkerchiefs at him. BLONDIN, the great French tomfool, brought more
people to Niagara Falls to see him, possibly, add a new Fall to the
prospect, than ever the Falls themselves did. And when another donkey
announces that he is going to stand upon his head on the point of a
church spire, that church is sure to be thronged&#8212;outside. These
performances, and all of their sort, should be made punishable, and
will probably be so when a hundred or two performers shall have been
killed, in addition to those who have already suffered.</p>
      <p>Not nearly so exciting as performances of the kind referred
to, though, perhaps, quite as rash, are the ocean voyages occasionally
essayed by tiny, toy ships. One of these&#8212;the <i>Red, White and Blue</i>&#8212;is
announced as about to start upon a "voyage round the world." We wish
her our best wishes, and hope she may get round in the roundest way and
time. One of her first stopping places, though, as we see, is Martha's
Vineyard. Our advice to the skipper of the toy ship, is to go no
further than that delightful haven of rest. MARTHA. will cherish her as
a chimney ornament, or give her to her kids to play with&#8212;and nobody
will be hurt.</p>

      <p><i>Stranger, New York City.</i>&#8212;When you get lost in our

information from a policeman. If he does not know where you are, come

      <p><i>Antiquary.</i>&#8212;"The Last of the Barons" was a term applied
to an implement used by the ancient shoemakers. The pedal members of
the old English barons were of a peculiar aristocratic conformation,
and lasts were made expressly for them. This is a curious fact not
generally known.</p>
      <p><i>Ploughboy</i> finds the following remark in Mr. GREELEY'S
thirtieth What, and asks explanation.</p>
      <p>"So with regard to Carrots. I have never achieved success in
growing these nor Beets."</p>
      <p>We infer that the meaning is, With regard to carrots, sow
them. "These nor Beets" are probably a new variety. They may have come
from Norfolk, but more "presumably" they were found in Alaska.</p>

manifestly incorrect. It has two negatives. "We ain't got any" is by
far more elegant.</p>

a dime in two at one stroke of his pen-knife, C. to hold the stakes. A.
took a ten-cent "scrip" and chopped it in two with his blade. Meantime
C. walked away with the stake money. Who won? <i>Answer.</i>&#8212;The bet
is off. C. is also off, but no better, and neither A. or B. is any
better off.</p>

      <p>An Every-day Romance.</p>
      <p>CHAPTER I.</p>
      <p>In a room in a palatial tenement house in Avenue D, stood
GILBERT FERNANDE FROU FROU SNOGGS. G.F.F.F.S. was rampant.</p>
      <p>"Why?" you say.</p>
      <p>Gentle reader, hurry me not. Let the tale wag on. She was
talking to her mamma.</p>
      <p>"Now," said G.F.F.F.S., "I prognosticated that my maternal
relative would become oblivions of my reiterated solicitations to
perambulate the Avenue, and make the acquisition of four yards of
cerulean hued ribbon," and she stamped her tiny number eights on the
floor.</p>
      <p>You will notice that, even in her anger, she did not forget
her English.</p>
      <p>"You can purchase it on the morrow," replied her mamma.</p>
      <p>"I will not remain acquiescent. I will promenade upon my
profluence to Sixth Avenue, and purchase the ceruleous ribbon
immediately," said G.F.F.F.S., putting on her waterproof and sun-bonnet.</p>
      <p>Her mother pointed to the paternal turnip, which hung over the
mantel, and showed her that old Time was "doing stunts" at 10-1/2.</p>
      <p>But G.F.F.F.S. was obstinate. She put on her chignon, her
curls, her breast elevator, her bustle, her high-heeled shoes, a little
rouge, a little whiting and a bit of court-plaster, and sallied forth,
down the dumb-waiter to the cellar, and thence, through the ash-hole,
to the street.</p>
      <p>CHAPTER II.</p>
      <p>The deed was done!!! The purchase was made find G.F.F.F.S.
walked towards her palatial paternal mansion. She felt slightly timid,
for, as she looked at the heavens, she saw that ARCTURUS, who had been
playing tag with CASTOR and POLLUX all the evening, had reached hunk,
the Great Bear. From the astronomical knowledge which she had acquired
at the Vavasour Female Academy, she knew that the paternal turnip now
pointed to the witching hour of 11-1/2.</p>
      <p>Suddenly she found herself surrounded by a party of bandits,
(she thought she was in Greece, but she was only in the 19th Ward.)</p>
      <p>They seized her.</p>
      <p>"Not a word," said the leader. "Your money or your life."</p>
      <p>Now G.F.F.F.S. had lots of life and very little money, so she
could hardly determine whether to give up some of her life or all of
her money.</p>
      <p>"Illustrious banditti," said she, "the auriferous contents of
my reticulated depository are notable for minuteness. Be conservators
of my pullulating existence."</p>
      <p>"I say, TOM," said the leader, "what's her little game?"</p>
      <p>"It sounds like Irish," said TOM.</p>
      <p>"Hand over your stamps," said the leader.</p>
      <p>G.F.F.F.S. slowly drew out her net purse, when suddenly the
robbers fled. G.F.F.F.S. felt that her hero had come, and, like all the
ARAMINTAS in the novels, she fainted and was caught in the arms of&#8212;</p>
      <p>CHAPTER III.</p>
      <p>The author tried to persuade the editor to allow him to write
"to be continued" after the last thrilling chapter, but the editor was
inexorable, hence this chapter, "in the arms of"&#8212;a little red-headed
policeman.</p>
      <p>G.F.F.F.S. smiled gently, but, as soon as she had opened her
eyes, and had cast them on the red head, freckled face, pug-nose, and
little eyes of MIKE MCFLYNN, she sprang to her feet. It was better than
forty gallons of hartshorn. She had wasted a faint.</p>
      <p>"<i>Perdidi animi deliquium</i>," said she.</p>
      <p>"Mother of MOSES, but you was heavy!" said MCFLYNN.</p>
      <p>But she did not wait, and a pair of number eight shoes might
have been seen by an inquisitive reporter, cutting around the corners
and stamping up seven flights of stairs.</p>
      <p>MORAL.</p>
      <p>When the paternal turnip solemnly points to 10-1/2, G.F.F.F.S.
puts her number eights on the mantel, looks reflectively at a sore-eyed
kitten, and falls into polysyllables.</p>

      <p><b>HOMODEIFICATION.</b></p>
      <p>Late advices from China convey the intelligence that the
American-Chinese General WARD, who died in the service of the Celestial
empire, has been postmortuarily brevetted to the rank of a "major god,"
and is now regularly worshipped as such by JOHN PIGTAIL.</p>
      <p>Possibly the antithesis to this may turn up on the cards,
here. In the course of events the bronze idol to which our PHILLIPSES
and SUMNERS used to bend the knee, has been prostrated from his
pedestal by the Fifteenth Amendment. Coolie labor, with its possible
abuses, may engage the attention of the philanthropists, next, and we
may yet behold JOHN PIGTAIL on a pedestal, in the character of an
American "major god."</p>

      <p><b>"LUCUS A NON," ETC.</b></p>
      <p>In the culinary department of a newspaper we find a recipe for
making "bird's nest pudding," which would surely make the pigtail of a
JOHN Chinaman stick straight up on end. The component parts of the
pudding are apples, sugar, milk, five eggs, and vanilla. Perhaps the
inventor of the pudding once found a bird's nest with five eggs in it,
and has thus essayed to immortalize the interesting fact.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
