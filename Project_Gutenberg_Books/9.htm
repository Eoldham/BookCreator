          <p style="font-weight: bold;">A POPULAR TREATISE</p>

          <p>For Young Wives and Mothers.</p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">BY T.S. VERDI, A.M.,
          M.D.,<br>
          OF WASHINGTON, D.C.</p><br>

          <p><small>DR. VERDI is a well-known and successful
          Homoeopathic Practitioner, of thorough scientific
          training and large experience. His book has arisen from a
          want felt in his own practice, as a Monitor to Young
          Wives, a Guide to Young Mothers, and an assistant to the
          family physician. It deals skilfully, sensibly, and
          delicately with the perplexities of early married life,
          as connected with the holy duties of Maternity, giving
          information which women must have, either in conversation
          with physicians, or from such a source as
          this&#8212;evidently the preferable mode of learning,
          for a delicate and sensitive woman. Plain and
          intelligible, but without offense to the most fastidious
          taste, the style of this book must commend it to careful
          perusal. It treats of the needs, dangers, and
          alleviations of the time of travail; and gives extended
          detailed instructions for the care and medical treatment
          of infants and children throughout all the perils of
          early life.</small></p>

          <p><small>As a Mother's Manual, it will have a large
          sale, and as a book of special and reliable information
          on very important topics, it will be heartily
          welcomed.</small></p>

          <p><small>Handsomely printed on laid paper: bevelled
          boards, extra English cloth, 12mo., 450 pages. Price

          <p>Judge SWEENEY, with a certain supercilious
          consciousness that he is figuring in a novel, and that it
          will not do for him to thwart the eccentricities of
          mysterious fiction by any commonplace deference to the
          mere meteorological weaknesses of ordinary human nature,
          does not allow the fact that late December is a rather
          bleak and cold time of year to deter him from taking
          daily airings in the neighborhood of the Ritualistic
          churchyard. Since the inscription of his epitaph on his
          late wife upon her monument therein, the churchyard is to
          him a kind of ponderous work of imagination with marble
          leaves, to which he has contributed the most brilliant
          chapter; and when he sees any stranger hovering about a
          part of the outer railings from whence the inscription
          may be read, it is with all the swelling pride of an
          author who, having procured the publication of some
          dreary article in a magazine, is thrown into an ecstacy
          of vanity if he sees but one person glance at that number
          of the periodical on a news-stand.</p>

          <p>Since his first meeting with Mr. BUMSTEAD, on the
          evening of the epitaph-reading, Judge SWEENEY has
          cultivated that gentleman's acquaintance, and been
          received at his lodgings several times with considerable
          cordiality and lemon-tea. On such occasions, Mr.
          BUMSTEAD, in his musical capacity, has sung so closely in
          Judge SWEENEY'S ear as to tickle him, a wild and slightly
          incoherent Ritualistic stave, to the effect that Saint
          PETER'S of Rome, with pontifical dome, would by ballot
          Infallible be; but for making Call sure, and Election
          secure, Saint Repeater's of Rum beats the See. With
          finger in ear to allay the tickling sensation, JUDGE
          SWEENEY declares that this young man smelling of cloves
          is a person of great intellectual attainments, and
          understands the political genius of his country well
          enough to make an excellent Judge of Election.</p>

          <p>Walking slowly near the churchyard on this particular
          freezing December evening, with his hands behind his
          bank, and his eyes intent for any envious husband who may
          be "with a rush retiring," monumentally counselled, after
          reading the Epitaph, Judge SWEENEY suddenly comes upon
          Father DEAN conversing with SMYTHE, the sexton, and Mr.
          BUMSTEAD. Bowing to these three, who, like himself, seem
          to find real luxury in open-air strolling on a bitter
          night in midwinter, he notices that his model, the Ritual
          Rector, is wearing a new hat, like Cardinal's, only
          black, and is immediately lost in wondering where he can
          obtain one like it short of Rome.</p>

          <p>"You look so much like an author, Mr. BUMSTEAD, in
          having no overcoat, wearing your paper collar upside
          down, and carrying a pen behind your ear," Father DEAN is
          saying, "that I can almost fancy you are about to write a
          book about us. Well, Bumsteadville is just the place to
          furnish a nice, dry, inoffensive domestic novel in the
          sedative vein."</p>

          <p>After two or three ineffectual efforts to seize the
          end of it, which he seems to think is an inch or two
          higher than its actual position, Mr. BUMSTEAD finally
          withdraws from between his right ear and head a long and
          neatly cut hollow straw.</p>

          <p>"This is not a pen, Holy Father," he answers, after a
          momentary glance of majestic severity at Mr. SMYTHE, who
          has laughed. "It is only a simple instrument which I use,
          as a species of syphon, in certain chemical experiments
          with sliced tropical fruit and glass-ware. In the
          precipitation of lemon-slices into cut crystal, it is
          necessary for the liquid medium to be exhausted
          gradually; and, after using this cylinder of straw for
          the purpose about an hour ago, I must have placed it
          behind my ear in a moment of absent-mindedness."</p>

          <p>"Ah, I see," said Father DEAN, although he didn't.
          "But what is this, Judge SWEENEY, respecting your
          introduction of MCLAUGHLIN to Mr. BUMSTEAD, which I have
          heard about?"</p>

          <p>"Why, your Reverence, I consider JOHN MCLAUGHLIN a
          Character," responds the Judge, "and thought our young
          friend of the organ-loft might like to study him."</p>

          <p>"The truth is," explains Mr. BUMSTEAD, "that Judge
          SWEENEY put into my head to do a few pauper graves with
          JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, some moonlight night, for the mere
          oddity and dampness of the thing.&#8212;And I should
          regret to believe," added Mr. BUMSTEAD, raising his voice
          as saw that the judiciary was about to
          interrupt&#8212;"And I should really be loathe to
          believe that Judge SWEENEY was not perfectly sober when
          he did so."</p>

          <p>"Oh, yes&#8212;certainly&#8212;I
          remember&#8212;to be sure," exclaims the Judge, in
          great haste; alarmed into speedy assent by the
          construction which he perceives would be put upon a
          denial. "I remember it very distinctly. I remember
          putting it into your head&#8212;by the tumblerful, if
          I remember rightly."</p>

          <p>"Profiting by your advice," continues Mr. BUMSTEAD,
          oblivious to the last sentence, I am going out to-night,
          in search of the moist and picturesque, with JOHN
          MCLAUGHLIN&#8212;"</p>

          <p>"Who is here," says Father DEAN.</p>

          <p>OLD MORTARITY, dinner-kettle in hand and more mortary
          than ever, indeed seen approaching them with shuffling
          gait. Bowing to the Holy Father, he is about to pass on,
          when Judge SWEENEY stops him with&#8212;</p>

          <p>"You must be very careful with your friend, BUMSTEAD,
          this evening, JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, and see that he don't fall
          and break his neck."</p>

          <p>"Never you worry about Mr. BUMSTEAD, Judge," growls
          OLD MORTARITY. "He can walk further off the perpendicklar
          without tumbling than any gentleman I ever see."</p>

          <p>"Of course I can, JOHN MCLAUGHLIN," says Mr. BUMSTEAD,
          checking another unseemly laugh of Mr. SMYTHE'S with a
          dreadful frown. "I often practice walking sideways, for
          the purpose of developing the muscles on that side. The
          left side is always the weaker, and the hip a trifle
          lower, if one does not counteract the difference by
          walking sideways occasionally."</p>

          <p>A great deal of unnecessary coughing, which follows
          this physiological exposition, causes Mr. BUMSTEAD to
          breathe hard at them all for a moment, and tread with
          great malignity upon Mr. SMYTHE'S nearest corn.</p>

          <p>While yet the sexton is groaning, OLD MORTARITY
          whispers to the Ritualistic organist that he will be
          ready for him at the appointed hour to-night, and
          shuffles away. After which Mr. BUMSTEAD, with the I
          hollow straw sticking out fiercely from his ear,
          privately offers to see Father DEAN home if he feels at
          all dizzy; and, being courteously refused, retires down
          the turnpike toward his own lodgings with military
          precision of step.</p>

          <p>When night falls upon the earth like a drop of ink
          upon the word Sun, and the stars glitter like the points
          of so many poised gold pens all ready to write the softer
          word Moon above the blot, the organist of St. Cow's sits
          in his own room, where his fire keeps-up a kind of
          aspenish twilight, and executes upon his accordeon a
          series of wild and mutilated airs. The moistened towel
          which he often wears when at home is turbaned upon his
          head, causing him to present a somewhat Turkish
          appearance; and as, when turning a particularly
          complicated corner in an air, it is his artistic habit to
          hold his tongue between his teeth, twist his head in
          sympathy with the elaborate fingering, and involuntarily
          lift one foot higher and higher from the floor as some
          skittish note frantically dodges to evade him, his
          general musical aspect at his own hearth is that of a
          partially Oriental gentleman, agonizingly laboring to
          cast from him some furious animal full of strange sounds.
          Thus engaging in desperate single combat with what, for
          making a ferocious fight before any recognizable tune can
          he rescued from it, is, perhaps, the most exhausting
          instrument known to evening amateurs and maddened
          neighborhoods, Mr. BUMSTEAD passes three athletic hours.
          At the end of that time, after repeatedly tripping-up its
          exasperated organist over wrong keys in the last bar, the
          accordeon finally relinquishes the concluding note with a
          dismal whine of despair, and retires in complete collapse
          to its customary place of waiting. Then the conquering
          performer changes his towel for a hat which would look
          better if it had not been so often worn in bed, places an
          antique black bottle in one pocket of his coat and a few
          cloves in the other; hangs an unlighted lantern before
          him by a cord passing about his neck, and, with his
          umbrella under his arm, goes softly down stairs and out
          of the house.</p>

          <p>Repairing to the marble-yard and home of OLD
          MORTARITY, which are on the outskirts of Bumsteadville,
          he wanders through mortar-heaps, monuments brought for
          repair, and piles of bricks, toward a whitewashed
          residence of small demensions with a light at the
          window.</p>

          <p>"JOHN McLAUGHLIN, ahoy!"</p>

          <p>In response, the master of the mansion promptly opens
          the door, and it is then perceptible that his basement,
          parlor, spare-bedroom and attic are all on one floor, and
          that a couple of pigs are spending the season with him.
          Showing his visitor into this ingeniously condensed
          establishment, he induces the pigs to retire to a corner,
          and then dons his hat.</p>

          <p>"Are you ready, JOHN MCLAUGHLIN?"</p>

          <p>"Please the pigs, I am, Mr. BUMSTEAD," answers
          MCLAUGHLIN, taking down from a hook a lantern, which,
          like his companion's, he hangs from his neck by a cord.
          "My spirits is equal to any number of ghosts to-night,
          sir, if we meet 'em."</p>

          <p>"Spirits!" ejaculates the Ritualistic organist,
          shifting his umbrella for a moment while he hurriedly
          draws the antique bottle from his pocket. "You're nervous
          to-night, J. MCLAUGHLIN, and need a little of the
          venerable JAMES AKER'S West Indian
          Restorative.&#8212;I'll try it first to make sure
          that I haven't mistaken the phial."</p>

          <p>He rests the elongated orifice of the diaphanous flask
          upon his lips for a brief interval of critical
          inspection, and then applies it thoughtfully to the mouth
          of OLD MORTARITY.</p>

          <p>"Some more! Some more!" pleads the aged MCLAUGHLIN,
          when the Jamaican nervine is abruptly jerked from his
          lips.</p>

          <p>"Silence! Com on," is the stern response of the other,
          who, as he moves from the house, and restores the crystal
          antiquity to its proper pocket, eats a few cloves by
          stealth. His manner plainly shows that he is offended at
          the quantity the old man has managed to swallow
          already.</p>

          <p>Strange indeed is the ghastly expedition to the place
          of skulls, upon which these two go thus by night. Not
          strange, perhaps, for Mr. MCLAUGHLIN, whose very youth in
          New York, where he was an active politician, found him a
          frequent nightly familiar of the Tombs; but strange for
          the organist, who, although often grave in his manner,
          sepulchral in his tones, and occasionally addicted to
          coughin', must be curiously eccentric to wish to pass
          into concert that evening with the dead heads.</p>

          <p>Transfixed by his umbrella, which makes him look like
          a walking cross between a pair of boots and a hat, Mr.
          BUMSTEAD leads the way athwart the turnpike and several
          fields, until they have arrived at a low wall skirting
          the foot of Gospeler's Gulch. Here they catch sight of
          the Reverend OCTAVIUS SIMPSON and MONTGOMERY PENDRAGON
          walking together, near the former's house, in the
          moonlight, and, instantaneously, Mr. BUMSTEAD opens his
          umbrella over the head of OLD MORTARITY, and drags him
          down beside himself under it behind the wall.</p>

          <p>"Hallo! What's all this?" gasps Mr. MCLAUGHLIN,
          struggling affrightedly in his suffocating cage of
          whalebone and alpaca. "What's this here old lady's
          hoop-skirt doing on me?"</p>

          <p>"Peace, wriggling dotard!" hisses BUMSTEAD, jamming
          the umbrella tighter over him. "If they see us they'll
          want some of the West Indian Restorative."</p>

          <p>Mr. SIMPSON and MONTGOMERY have already heard a sound;
          for they pause abruptly in their conversation, and the
          latter asks: "Could it have been a ghost?"</p>

          <p>"Ask it if it's a ghost," whispers the Gospeler,
          involuntarily crossing himself.</p>

          <p>"Are you there, Mr. G.?" quavers the raised voice of
          the young Southerner, respectfully addressing the inquiry
          to the stone wall.</p>

          <p>No answer.</p>

          <p>"Well," mutters the Gospeler, "it couldn't have been a
          ghost, after all; but I certainly thought I saw an
          umbrella. To conclude what I was saying,
          then,&#8212;I have the confidence in you, Mr.
          MONTGOMERY, to believe that you will attend the dinner of
          Reconciliation on Christmas eve, as you have
          promised."</p>

          <p>"Depend on me, sir."</p>

          <p>"I shall; and have become surety for your punctuality
          to that excellent and unselfish healer of youthful
          wounds, Mr. BUMSTEAD."</p>

          <p>More is said after this; but the speakers have
          strolled to the other side of the Gospeler's house, and
          their words cannot be distinguished Mr. BUMSTEAD closes
          his umbrella with such suddenness and violence as to
          nearly pull off the head of MCLAUGHLIN; drives his own
          hat further upon his nose with a sounding blow; takes
          several wild swallows from his antique flask; eats two
          cloves, and chuckles hoarsely to himself for some
          minutes. "Here, 'JOHN MCLAUGHLIN," he says, at last "try
          a little more West Indian Restorative, and then we'll go
          and do a few skeletons."</p>

          of June 30, 1864, chap. 171," "An act to increase Duties
          on Imports," etc., we find "on paddy one cent and a half
          per pound." Now if a good-sized Irishman pays $2.25, why

          <p><b>COMIC ZOOLOGY.</b></p>

          <p><b>Genus Culex.&#8212;The American
          Mosquito</b></p>

          <p>Few American birds are better known than the mosquito.
          In common with the woodcock, snipe, and other winged
          succubi, it breeds in wet places, yet is always dry. Like
          them it can sustain life on mud juleps, but prefers
          "cluret." It is a familiar creature, seems to regard the
          human family as its Blood relations, and is always ready
          to sucker them.</p>

          <p>Being a bird of Nocturnal Habits, it is particularly
          attracted to human beings in their Night-shirts. The
          swallow preys upon it, but it generally eludes the Bat.
          Although it cannot be called Noctilucous, like the
          lightning bug, it has no objection to alight in the
          darkness, and you often knock till you cuss in your vain
          attempts to prevent its taking a Shine to you.</p>

          <p>The mosquito differs in most respects from all the
          larger varieties of the winged tribes, and upon the whole
          takes after man more than any other living thing.
          Nevertheless, it certainly bears a noticeable resemblance
          to some of the feathered race. Like the Nightingale, it
          "sings darkling," and like the woodpecker, is much
          addicted to tapping the bark of Limbs and Trunks for the
          purpose of obtaining grub. It may be mentioned as an
          amiable idiosyncracy of the mosquito, that it is fond of
          babies. If there is a child in the house, it is sure to
          spot the playful innocent; and by means of an ingenious
          contrivance combining the principles of the gimlet and
          the air-pump, it soon relieves the little human bud of
          its superfluous juices. It is, in fact, a born surgeon, a
          Sangrado of the Air, and rivals that celebrated Spanish
          Leech in its fondness for phlebotomy. Some infidels, who
          do not subscribe to the doctrine that nothing was made in
          vain, consider it an unmitigated nuisance, but the devout
          and thoughtful Christian recognizes it as Nature's
          preventive of plethora, and as it alternately breathes a
          Vein and a song, it may be said (though we never heard
          the remark,) to combine the <i>utile</i> with the
          <i>dulce</i>.</p>

          <p>All the members of the genus are slender and graceful
          in their shape and Gnatty in their general appearance.
          The common mosquito is remarkable for its strong
          attachments. It follows man with more than canine
          fidelity, and in some cases, the dog-like pertinacity of
          its affection can only be restrained by Muslin. It is of
          a roving disposition, seldom remaining settled long in
          one locality; and is Epicurean in its
          tastes&#8212;always living, if possible, on the fat
          of the land. As the mosquito produces no honey, mankind
          in general are not as sweet upon it as they are upon that
          bigger hum-bug, the buzzy bee; yet it is so far akin to
          the bee, that, wherever it forages, it produces something
          closely resembling Hives.</p>

          <p>Few varieties of game are hunted more industriously
          than this, yet such is the fecundity of the species, that
          the Sportsman's Club has not as yet thought it necessary
          to petition the legislature for its protection.</p>

          <p>The New Jersey Mosquito is the largest known specimen
          of the genus, except the Southern Gallinipper, which is
          only a few sizes smaller than the Virginia Nightingale,
          and raises large speckles similar to those of the Thrush.
          Ornithologists who wish to study the habits of the
          mosquito in its undomesticated or nomad state, may find
          it in angry clouds on the surface of the New Jersey salt
          marshes at this season, in company with its teetering
          long-billed Congener, the Sandsnipe.</p>

          <p>During the last month of summer it reigns supreme in
          the swamps west of Hoboken, the August Emperor of all the
          Rushes, and persons of an apoplectic turn, who wish to
          have their surplus blood determined to the surface
          instead of to the head, will do well to seek the hygienic
          insect there.</p><br>

          <p><b>An Apt Quotation.</b></p>

          <p>The name "Louvre" has now been adopted by several
          places of entertainment in New York and its suburbs. A
          Boston gentleman, who visited seven of them a night or
          two since, under the escort of a policeman, declares
          that, by a slight alteration of a line of MOORE's, New
          York may be well described as&#8212;</p>

          <p>"A place for Louvres, and for Louvres only."</p><br>

          <p><b>THE WATERING PLACES</b>.</p>

          <p><b>Punchinello's Vacations</b>.</p>

          <p>Mr. PUNCHINELLO puts up at the Atlantic Hotel when he
          goes to Cape May; and if you were to ask him why, he
          would tell you that it was on account of the admirable
          water-punches which JOHN McMAKIN serves up. To be sure
          these mixtures do not agree with Mr. P., but he likes to
          see people enjoying themselves, even if he can't do it
          himself. It is this unselfish disposition, this love of
          his fellow-men, that enables him to maintain that
          constant good humor so requisite to his calling. In fact,
          though Mr. P. often says sharp things, he never gets
          angry. When, on Thursday of last week, he was walking
          down the south side of Jackson street, and a man asked
          him did he want to buy a bag, Mr. P. was not enraged. He
          knew the man took him for a greenhorn, but then the man
          himself was a Jerseyman. It is no shame to be a greenhorn
          to a Jerseyman. Quite the reverse. Mr. P. would blush if
          he thought there lived a "sand-Spaniard" who could not
          take advantage of him. So Mr. P. bought the bag, and
          because it was made of very durable canvas, and would
          last a great while, he paid a dollar for it.</p>

          <p>He did not ask what it was for. He knew. It was to put
          Cape May Diamonds in! He put the bag in his pocket and
          walked along the beach for three miles. You can't walk
          more than three miles here, and if you hire a carriage
          you will find that you can't ride less than that
          distance. Which makes it bad, sometimes. However, when
          Mr. P. had finished his three miles, he didn't want to go
          any further. He stopped, and gazing carelessly around to
          see that no one noticed him, pulled out his canvas bag
          and did shuffle a little in the sand with his feet. He
          <span style="font-style: italic;">might</span> find some
          diamonds, you know, just as likely as any of the hundreds
          of other people, who, in other sequestered parts of the
          beach, were pulling out other canvas bags, and shuffling
          in the sand with other feet. At length Mr. P. shuffled
          himself into a very sequestered nook indeed, and there he
          saw a man smoking. His melancholy little boy was sitting
          by his side. Perceiving that it was only General GRANT,
          Mr. P. advanced with his usual grace and suavity of
          manner.</p>

          <p>"Why, Mr. President!" said he, "I thought you would be
          found at Long Branch this season."</p>

          <p>"Long&#8212;thunder!" ejaculated the General, his
          face as black as the ace of spades, (which, by the way,
          is blue.) "I might go to Nova Zembla for a quiet smoke,
          and some sneaking politician would crawl out from the ice
          with a petition. I went fishing in Pennsylvania, and I
          found twenty of those fellows to every trout. However, I
          don't mind you. Take a seat and have a cigar."</p>

          <center>
            <img src="images/06a.jpg" alt="">
          </center>

          <p>Mr. P. took the seat, (which was nothing to brag of,)
          and a cigar, (which would have been a great deal to brag
          of, if he had succeeded in smoking it,) and, after a
          whiff or two, asked his companion how it was that he came
          to send such a message to Congress about Cuba.</p>

          <p>"What message?" said GRANT, absently.</p>

          <p>Mr. P. explained.</p>

          <p>"Oh," said GRANT, "that one! Didn't you like it? CALEB
          CUSHING wrote it and brought it to me, and I signed it.
          If you had written one and brought it to me, I would have
          signed that. 'Tisn't my fault if the thing's wrong. What
          would you expect of a man?"</p>

          <p>Mr. P. concluded that in this case it was ridiculous
          to expect anything else, and so he changed the
          subject.</p>

          <p>That afternoon Mr. P. bathed.</p>

          <p>He went to SLOAN'S and fitted himself out in a bathing
          suit, and very lovely he looked in it, when he emerged
          from the bathing house at high tide. With a red tunic;
          green pants; and a very yellow hat, he resembled a
          frog-legged Garibaldian, ready for the harvest.</p>

          <p>When he hurried to the water's edge, he hesitated for
          a moment. The roaring surf was so full of heads, legs,
          arms, back-hair, hats and feet, that he feared there was
          no room for him. However, he espied a vacancy, and
          plunged into the briny deep.</p>

          <p>How delicious! How cool! How fresh! How salt! How
          splendid!</p>

          <p>He struck out with his legs; he struck out with his
          arms; he dived with his whole body. He skimmed beneath
          the green waters; he floated on the rolling wave-tips; he
          trod water; he turned heels over head in the emerald
          depths; and thus, gamboling like an Infant Triton, he
          passed out beyond the breakers. It was very pleasant
          there. Being a little tired, he found the change from the
          surging waves to the gentle chuck and flop of the deep
          water, most delightful. Languidly, to rest himself, he
          threw his arm over a rock just peeping above the water.
          But the rock gave a start and a yawn.</p>

          <p>It was a sleeping shark!</p>

          <p>The startled fish opened his eyes to their roundest,
          and backed water.</p>

          <p>So did Mr. P.</p>

          <p>For an instant they gazed at each other in utter
          surprise. Then the shark began slowly to sink. Mr. P.
          knew what that meant. The monster was striving to get
          beneath him for the fatal snap!</p>

          <p>Mr. P. sank with him!</p>

          <p>With admirable presence of mind he kept exactly even
          with the fish.</p>

          <center>
            <img src="images/06b.jpg" alt="">
          </center>

          <p>At last they reached the bottom.</p>

          <p>Mr. P. was nearly suffocated, but he determined that
          he would strangle rather than rise first. The shark
          endeavored to crawl under him, but Mr. P. clung to the
          bottom.</p>

          <p>The fish then made a feint of rising, but, in an
          instant, Mr. P. had him around the waist!</p>

          <p>The affrighted shark darted to the surface, and Mr. P.
          inhaled at least a gallon of fresh air. Never before had
          oxygen tasted so good!</p>

          <p>On the surface the struggle was renewed, but Mr. P.
          always kept undermost.</p>

          <p>At last they rested from the contest, and lay panting
          on the surface of the water, glaring at each other.</p>

          <p>The shark, who was a master of <i>finesse</i>, swam
          out a little way, to where the water was deeper, and then
          slowly sank, intending, if Mr. P. followed him again to
          the bottom, to stay there long enough to drown the
          unfortunate man. But Mr. P. knew a trick worth two of
          that.</p>

          <p><i>He didn't follow him at all</i>! He swam towards
          shore as fast as he could, and when the shark looked
          around, to see if he was coming, he was safe within the
          line of surf.</p>

          <p>Need it be said that when he reached dry laud, Mr. P.
          became a hero with the crowds who had witnessed this
          heroic struggle?</p>

          <p>That evening, as Mr. P. sat upon the portico of his
          hotel, there came unto him, in the moonlight, a maiden of
          the latest fashion.</p>

          <p>"Sir," she softly murmured "are you the noble hero who
          overcame the shark?"</p>

          <p>Mr. P. looked up at her.</p>

          <p>Her soft eyes were dimmed with irresponsible
          emotion.</p>

          <p>"I am," said he.</p>

          <p>The maiden stood motionless. Her whole frame was
          agitated by a secret struggle.</p>

          <p>At length she spoke.</p>

          <p>"Is there a Mrs. P.?" she softly said.</p>

          <p>Mr. P. arose. He grasped the back of his chair with
          trembling hand. His manly form quivered with a secret
          struggle.</p>

          <p>He looked upon her!</p>

          <p>He gazed for a moment, with glowing, passionate eyes,
          upon that matchless form&#8212;upon that angelic
          face, and then&#8212;he clasped his brows in hopeless
          agony. Stepping back, he gave the maiden one glance of
          wildest love, followed by another of bitterest despair;
          and sank helpless into his chair.</p>

          <p>The maiden leaned, pale and trembling, against a
          pillar; but hearing the approach of intruders, she
          recovered herself with an effort.</p>

          <p>"Farewell," she whispered. "I know! I know! There
          <i>is</i> a Mrs. P.!"&#8212;and she was gone.</p>

          <p>Mr. P. arose and slipped out into the night, shaken by
          a secret struggle. He laid upon the sand and kicked up
          his heels.</p>

          <p><i>There isn't any</i> Mrs. P.!</p>

          <p>Mr. P. does not wish to sweep his hand rudely o'er the
          tender chords of any heart, but he wants it known that he
          is neither to be snapped up by sharks in the sea, or by
          young women at watering places.</p><br>

          <p><b>A DOG'S TALE</b>.</p>

          <p><b>Dogmatic</b>.</p>

          <p>I am only a dog, I admit; but do you suppose dogs have
          no feeling? I guess if you were kicked out of every
          door-way you ran into, and driven away from every meat
          stand or grocery you happened to smell around, you would
          think you had feelings.</p>

          <p>When I see some dogs riding in carriages, looking so
          grandly out of the windows, or others walking along
          proudly by the side of their owners, I have a feeling of
          dislike for the very thought of liberty!</p>

          <p>I sometimes go with the crowd to a lecture-room, and
          listen to the speeches about freedom and liberty, the
          hatred of bondage, and all that sort of thing. I get my
          tail up, and wish I could tell them what liberty really
          is. There is nothing worse in the world than this running
          around loose, with no one to look after you, and no one
          for you to look after; no one to notice you when you wag
          your tail, and to have no occasion for so doing. You go
          out and you come in, and nobody cares. If you never come
          back, no one troubles himself about you.</p>

          <p>Every day I hear men reading in the papers about some
          lucky dogs having strayed, or having been stolen, a large
          reward being offered for their recovery: and I envy each
          lost dog! I wonder who would advertise for me if I got
          lost! Alas! no one. They would not give me a bone to
          bring me back, or to keep me from drowning myself. But
          every boy in the street thinks he has a right to throw
          stones at me; and tie tin-kettles to my tail; and chase
          me when I have had the good luck to find a bone; and to
          set big dogs upon me to worry me when I am faint from
          hunger and haven't much pluck; and worse than all, chase
          me and cry "Ki-yi," when I am almost dying of thirst!</p>

          <p>If you only knew how hard it is for a poor dog to make
          his way in the world, with no one to help him to a
          mouthful of food, you would feel sorry for us.</p>

          <p>But I think we might get along better if it wasn't for
          the scarcity of water. I hardly know a spot in the city
          where I can get a drink; and many a time I have gone all
          day without a drop.</p>

          <p>If I happen to hang out my tongue and droop my tail,
          my ears are saluted with "Mad dog! Let's kill him!" You
          need not wonder I sometimes turn round, and snap at my
          pursuers. I think you would snap, too, if you were chased
          through street and lane and alley, till your blood was in
          a perfect fever, and you hardly knew which way you were
          running! I have, on many such occasions, actually run
          past a beautiful bone that lay handy on the side-walk,
          and never stopped to smell it.</p>

          <p>Oh! I wish some one would take me prisoner, and
          continue to own me, and keep me in bondage as long as I
          lived! I should only be too happy to give up my liberty,
          and settle down and be a respectable dog!</p><br>

          <p>The Marquis of Bute denies that he is going to return
          to the Protestant fold. With reference to the rumor, the
          Pope stated in the Ecumenical Council that "the Bute was

          thunder against him who should dare that Bute
          displace."</p><br>

          <p><b>WHAT IS IT</b>?</p>

          <p>As the shades of night descend (in the neighborhood of
          Mecklenburg, N.C.,) and harmless domestic animals begin
          to compose themselves to sleep, suddenly the drowsy world
          is awakened by a roaring like that of a lion! It proceeds
          from the forest, in whose bosky recesses (as the
          Mecklenburgers suppose) some terrible creature proclaims
          his hunger and his inclination to appease it with human
          flesh! All night long the quaking denizens of that hamlet
          lie and listen to the roaring, which is an effectual
          preventive of drowsiness, as the moment any one begins to
          be seized with it he also begins to fancy he is about to
          be seized and deglutinated by the horrid monster!
          Naturalists are positive it is not the Gyascutis, but
          admit that a Megatherium may have lately awakened from
          the magnetic sleep of ages, with the pangs of a mighty
          hunger tearing his wasted viscera.</p>

          <p>If our theory is correct, the good people of
          Mecklenburg (was it not in Mecklenburg that the agitation
          for Independence began?) may be assured that deliverance
          from this unreasonable Dragon is possible. We think it
          more than likely that it is simply GEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN
          practicing for the next invasion of Great Britain.
          Nothing could be more harmless. One Ku-Kluxian youth,
          armed with a double-barrelled shot-gun, four
          bowie-knives, and a number of revolvers, could rout him
          instantly, and even check the flow of his vociferous
          eloquence so suddenly as to put him in imminent danger of
          asphyxia.</p><br>

          <p><b>HINTS FOR&#8212;THOSE WHO WILL TAKE
          THEM</b>.</p>

          <p>Mr. PUNCHINELLO: Your invaluable "Hints for the
          Family," published some time since, seem destined to work
          a revolution in our domestic economy; as the plans you
          propose must win the admiration of housekeepers by their
          extreme simplicity, aside from any other motives to their
          adoption. I have myself tested several of your methods,
          and find that you speak from thorough and circumstantial
          knowledge of your subject In bread-making, for instance,
          we find that when the cat reposes in the dough, it (the
          dough) will not rise, though the cat does. But in the
          clock manufacture, we fear you have divulged one of the
          secrets of the trade.</p>

          <p>Your little invention for carrying a thread should be
          recommended to students and other isolated beings,
          notwithstanding their unaccountable propensity to pierce
          other substances than the cloth. They would find driving
          the needle through much facilitated by a skilful use of
          the table formerly described.</p>

          <p>Permit me to make a few additional suggestions.</p>

          <p>Get some worsted and a pair of needles; set up from
          twenty to forty stitches, more or less, and knit till you
          are tired. When finished&#8212;(the
          knitting)&#8212;draw out the needles and bite off the
          thread. You will thus have made an elegant lamp-mat, of
          the same color as the worsted, and the very thing for a
          Christmas present to your grandmother.</p>

          <p>This is a very graceful employment, and a great
          favorite with ladies; in fact, some ladies seem so
          infatuated with work of that kind, that, according to the
          new theory of the Future, a fruition of fancy-work will
          be amongst their other blissful realizations. And so,
          after surveying Deacon QUIRK'S spiritual potato fields,
          or perhaps some fresh (spiritual) manifestation of Miss
          PHELPS'S piety and intelligence, we may have the pleasure
          of seeing the sun and moon hung with tidies, and a
          lamp-mat under each star.</p>

          <p>Take your rejected sketches and compositions, cut them
          in strips two or three inches wide, and as long as the
          paper will permit. Fold these strips lengthwise as narrow
          as possible, and smooth the edges down flat with your
          finger. When finished, or perhaps before, you will find
          you have made a bunch of excellent lamp-lighters.</p>

          <p>Get a suit of clothes&#8212;broadcloth is the
          best&#8212;and a pair of boots to stand them in.
          Button the coat, and insert in the neck any vegetable you
          choose, so that it be large enough, (one of the drum-head
          species is the best,) and finish with a hat You will then
          find, doubtless to your surprise and delight, that you
          have <b>a man</b>, or an excellent substitute for one,
          equal, if not superior to the genuine article, warranted
          to be always pleased with his dinner, and never,
          necessarily, in the way. Some people may object to its
          lack of intelligence, as compared with the original, but
          careful investigation has shown that the difference is
          very slight; yet, admitting even this to be a positive
          fault, it is amply counterbalanced by negative merits.
          Your correspondent who writes about "The Real Estate of
          Woman," will be relieved to find that the threatened
          dearth in husbands can be so readily obviated.</p>

          <p>You have ceased the dilemer by the horn which hangs

          <p>That's so. A vote's a vote, if it comes from

          a good deal towards you as a nabor of mine, named JOE
          BELCHER, once did.</p>

          <p>JOE went to camp meetin' last week, and, I am pained
          to say it, JOSEF got drunker than a biled owl.</p>

          <p>While one of the brethern was preachin', JOE sot on a
          pine log tryin' to make out wether the preacher was a
          double-headed man, or whether 2 men were holdin'
          forth.</p>

          <p>"Who'll stand up for the carpenter's Son?" sed the
          preacher.</p>

          <p>This made JOE look around.</p>

          <p>The question was again repeated.</p>

          <p>Again JOE looked around for an answer.</p>

          <p>Again the preacher said: "Who'll stand up for
          Him?"</p>

          <p>JOE by this time had got onto his feet, and was
          steadyin' himself by holdin' onto a tree, while he sung
          out:</p>

          <p>"I say (hic!) ole feller, Ile stand up (hic!) for him,
          or any 'orrer man who hain't got any (hic!) more fren's
          than he has (hic!) in this 'ere crowd."</p>

          <p>I feel a good deal as JOE did. Anybody who hain't got
          any more frends than you have, Mr. SAMPSON, has my
          sympathy.</p>

          <p>For bringin' these <i>hily morril</i> and

          feather in your cap, and you will receive your reward
          bime-bye.</p>

          <p>"The wages of sin is death."</p>

          <p>But the wages of a Chinyman is money in a man's
          pocket. They work cheap.</p>

          healthy.</p>

          <p>Mrs. SAMPSON worked like a kag of apple sass in hot
          weather, to find out where her old man's strength was.
          When she found out, what did she do? Why, she got a pair
          of sheep shears and cropped him closer'n a state prison
          bird, and tryin' to lift a house full of fokes, it fell
          onto him and smashed him.</p>

          <p>Like LOT'S wife, she'd orter been turned into a pillow
          of salt, and then the pillow had orter been sewed up and
          cast into the sea.</p>

          <p>Another of the SAMPSONS wouldn't even chop off MARIAR
          ANTERNETTE'S head until her hair had been cut off, so he
          could peel her top-knot off slick and cleen.</p>

          <p>Lookin' back at these cheerful antsisters of your'n,
          it's no wonder you go in for long haired labor. It runs
          in the SAMPSON blood.</p>

          <p><b>TREATMENT FOR POTATO BUGS</b>.</p>

          <p>Mr. CLARK JOHNSON, of Pendleton, Indiana, not at all
          discouraged by the signal failures of many previous
          campaigns against the Bug, has entered the (potato) field
          with a new weapon, viz.: a mixture of Paris Green and
          Ashes. Applied frequently, as a Top Dressing, this gentle
          stimulant imparts a new energy to the vine, and also to
          the Bug, who thus becomes so vigorous, and at the same
          time restless, that an uncontrollable impulse seizes him
          to visit the home of his ancestors, (Colorado.) Here, as
          is supposed by Mr. JOHNSON, the fictitious energy that
          had been supplied by the Mixture deserts the immigrant,
          who now settles down contentedly, nor ever roams
          again.</p>

          <p>As (owing to the present facilities of freighting,
          etc.,) the Potatoes of Pendleton may eventually find the
          New York market, which always invites the superior
          esculent, we would like to suggest to Mr. JOHNSON that
          this Mixture be administered to the Bug with a spoon, and
          not sprinkled promiscuously on the ground. We have drank
          Tea with a "green flavor," and found it comparatively
          innocuous; but Potatoes with a green flavor, (especially
          if flavored by the JOHNSONIAN method,) we should consider
          as doubtful, to say the least. It is the general
          impression that there is nothing Green in Paris; but your
          house painter knows there is such a thing as Paris Green,
          and that it is the oxyde of copper. Therefore, should one
          eat many of the potatoes nourished as above, we should
          expect to see him gradually turning into a Bronze
          Statue&#8212;a fate which, unless he were
          particularly Greeky and nice-looking, we should wish to
          anticipate, if possible, in the interests of art.</p><br>

          <p><b>OUR AGRICULTURAL COLUMN.</b></p>

          <p><b>Memorabilia of "What I Know About Farming."</b></p>

          <p>Profound subjects should be well meditated upon. A man
          may write about "New America," or "Spiritual Wives," or
          any such light and airy subject, without possessing much
          knowledge, or indulging in much thought, but he can't
          play such tricks upon Agriculture. She is very much like
          a donkey: unless you are thoroughly acquainted with her
          playful ways, she will upset you in a quagmire. Perhaps
          it is due to my readers that I should say here that I
          have read a great many valuable treatises upon this
          subject, among which may be named, "Cometh up as a
          Flour," "Anatomy of Melon-cholly," "Sowing and Reaping,"
          one thousand or two volumes of Patent Office Reports, and
          three or four bushels of "Proverbial Philosophy." I would
          also add, that I invariably remain awake on clear nights,
          and think out the ideas set down in this column. Probably
          you may not be able to find traces of all that labor
          here, but I assure you that those books are more familiar
          to me than is my catechism. However, anybody who thinks
          he knows more about vegetables than I do, can send me a
          letter containing his information, and, if I don't
          cabbage it, I will plant it carefully in the bottom of
          the waste paper basket. We now proceed to consider.</p>

          <p>PAR'S NIPS.</p>

          <p>This vegetable always flourishes in a moist soil,
          though it generally has a holy horror of <i>aqua
          pura</i>. Some of them are of an immense size; I have
          seen them fill a tumbler. Producers, however, generally
          charge more for the large ones than for the small. The
          size of the nip usually depends upon the par. It may be
          that your par's nip is extremely small, while JOHN
          SMITH'S par's nip is very large. Four fingers is, I
          believe, considered to be the regulation size.</p>

          <p>This vegetable is served up in a variety of forms.
          Some pars like it with milk; in that case it is generally
          "hung up." In the winter it is often called a sling or a
          punch; in the summer it is denominated a cobbler or a
          jew-lip. Perhaps it would be well for those who love it,
          to indulge in par's nip now, for some people say, that in
          the days of the "coming man" there will be no par's nips.
          It must be admitted that the father of a family, who
          indulges too freely in par's nip, is very likely to run
          to seed, and to plant himself in such unfruitful places
          as the gutter. If he be a young par, he may become a
          rake, and fork over his money, and then ho! for the
          alms-house.</p>

          <p>Numerous efforts have been made to suppress this
          vegetable, among which may be reckoned, "Father, dear
          Father, come home with me now," Brother GOUGH'S circus,
          and the parades of the F.M.T.A.B. Societies. Maine and
          Vermont Neal together in the front rank of its opponents.
          In Boston they tried to suppress this vegetable, but, if
          you followed your par to a store and heard him order a
          cracker, you could smell par's nip.</p>

          <p>Among the mild varieties of this article may be
          mentioned benzine, camphene and kerosene; the next
          strongest kind is called Jersey lightning; but, if you
          desire par's nips in their most luxuriant form, go to
          Water street and try the species known as
          "rot-gut."</p><br>

          <p><b>OUR PORTFOLIO.</b></p>

          <p>Poetry is the exclusive birthright of no age of
          people. The dirtiest Hindoo sings to his <i>fetish</i>
          the songs of the Brahmin muse, with as keen a relish as
          the most devout Christian does the hymns of Dr. WATTS.
          Melody comes of Heaven, and is a gift vouchsafed to all
          generations, and all kinds of men. In proof of this, let
          us adduce a single extract from the great epic of the
          Hawaiian poet, POPPOOFI, entitled "Ka Nani
          E!"</p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Ka nani e! ka
          nani e!</span><br>

          nei,</span><br>
          <span style="margin-left: 3em;">A ma na mea a
          pau.</span><br>

          <p>We would call the attention of our readers
          particularly to the sublime sentiment of the second line.
          "Alohi puni no," sings the peerless POPPOOFI, and where,
          in the pages of that other Oriental HOMER, the Persian
          HAFI, can be found anything half so magnificent? There
          may be critics bigoted enough to think that the last line
          destroys the effect of the other three; but <i>we</i>
          don't. PUNCHINELLO would much rather discover the good in
          a thing at any time, than go a-fishing on Sundays.</p>

          <p>It is not in the nature of a properly constituted
          human being to lay his hand upon his heart and
          chant:</p><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">"Ka nani e!

          <p><b>THE PLAYS AND SHOWS</b>.</p>

          <p><img src="images/13.jpg" align="left" alt="E">mmet is
          a name which has heretofore been associated in the public
          mind with the Negro Minstrel business. Certain weird
          barbaric melodies, which defy all laws of musical
          composition, but which haunt one like a dream of a lonely
          night on some wild African river, are said to have been
          written by "OLD EMMET." Is there any such person? Has any
          one actually seen "OLD EMMET" in the flesh, and
          with&#8212;say a high hat and a cotton umbrella? For
          my part I disbelieve in the popular theory of the origin
          of these EMMETIC melodies which stir one so strangely.
          They are not the work of any earthly song writer, but are
          born of some untuned Eolian harp played upon by uncertain
          breezes, that murmur the memory of tropical groves and
          sigh with the sadness of exile. There is no "OLD EMMET."
          If there is, let him be brought forward&#8212;not to
          be chucked out of the window, as Mrs. F.'s AUNT might
          suggest,&#8212;but to be thanked and wondered at as
          an inchoate OFFENBACH, who might, under other
          circumstances, have written an American opera-bouffe, or,
          better still, as a possible CHOPIN, who might have
          written a second "March Fun&#233;bre" as hopeless and
          desolate and fascinating as that of the despairing and
          poetic Pole. (I am coming to "FRITZ" in a moment, but I
          won't be hurried by any one.)</p>

          <p>As for JOSEPH K. EMMET, he is an undoubted reality. If
          you don't believe it, go to WALLACK'S and see him.
          Somebody discovered this EMMET in the Pastoral privacy of
          the Bowery. Mr. GAYLER was made to write a play for him,
          and EMMET, the Bowery Minstrel, straightway became Mr.
          JOSEPH K. EMMET, the renowned impersonator of "FRITZ." He
          plays "FRITZ" at WALLACK'S every evening, and the
          entertainment is something of this nature.</p>

          funny in this place."</p>

          <p>OLD GENTLEMAN. "My dear! don't be absurd. Suppose Mr.
          EMMET has been a minstrel, is that any proof that he
          can't be an actor? The young fellow has his faults, but
          they will wear off in time, and he is brimful of real
          talent. The play isn't a model of excellence, but it was
          made to show EMMET'S strong points, and it answers its
          purpose. Shall we cry down a talented and promising young
          actor simply because he has been a minstrel, and now has
          the audacity to play at WALLACK'S? And besides, haven't
          we seen pantomime, and legs, and LOTTA, and DAN BRYANT at
          WALLACK'S? You never objected to any of the
          illegitimacies that have preceded FRITZ;&#8212;why
          then should you begin now? Give EMMET and GAYLER a
          chance. At any rate they can make you laugh, which is
          something that BOUCICAULT with his '<i>Lost at Sea</i>'
          did not do."</p>

          <p><b>A PARABLE ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF JULY</b>.</p>

          <p>In a far distant land, beyond the sea, there dwelt an
          Orange Lily. Separated from it by a very absurd and
          useless ditch, a Green Shamrock spread its trefoil
          leafage to the sun, and grew greener every day. Now, in
          course of time, a very ill feeling sprang up between the
          Lily and the Shamrock, on account of color, the former
          despising the latter because it was green, and the latter
          hating the former because it was orange&#8212;as if
          both colors hadn't lived together in the rainbow ever
          since the aquatic excursion of old Mr. NOAH, without ever
          falling out of it or with each other. In time they both
          crossed the sea, and took root in a far-away land, where
          they became acquainted with a very remarkable animal
          called the American Beaver.</p>

          <p>The industry of this creature urged the Lily to toil
          and spin, contrary to its usual habits, while the
          Shamrock converted its trifoliated leaves into shovels,
          and took a contract for excavating the hemisphere. And so
          they might have jogged on very well together, but for
          their stupid way of showing their colors when there was
          no occasion for it. This greatly disgusted their friend,
          the American Beaver, who didn't care a pinch of snuff
          about color, (black is not a color, you know,) but who
          went in for faithful and persistent work. One beautiful
          Twelfth of July, the Lily arose very early in the
          morning, and, shaking out her orange leaves, defied the
          Shamrock to "come on." The Shamrock came on. There was a
          vegetable howl, and clash, and clangor in the air, and
          the Lily, having knocked off several of the Shamrocks'
          greenest leaves, went to its friend, the American Beaver,
          for comfort and support. But the American Beaver, instead
          of countenancing the Lily, said: "Look here, Lily, I
          guess you are about the greatest fool I ever <i>did</i>
          see, except, perhaps, the Shamrock. As long as you two
          stick to your work, instead of sticking out your colors
          and sticking your knives into each other, I am very glad
          to have you for neighbors, but now that you have shown
          yourselves to be jack-asses instead of vegetables, I
          would not give an American Beaver dam for the two of
          you."</p><br>

          <p><b>CONDENSED CONGRESS.</b></p>

          <p><b>SENATE.</b></p>

          <p><img src="images/14.jpg" align="left" alt="A">
          pleasant philosopher tells us that blessings brighten as
          they take their flight. The flight of Congress may be
          regarded as a blessing. But Congressmen do not brighten.
          PUNCHINELLO listens in vain for the swan song of SUMNER,
          and looks longingly, without being gratified by the
          spectacle of the oratorical funeral pyre of NYE. Almost
          the only gleam of humor he discerns in his weekly wading
          through the watery and windy wastes of the Congressional
          Globe is a comic coruscation by Mr. CAMERON.</p>

          <p>Mr. McCREERY had had the abominable impudence to
          introduce a bill relieving the disabilities of a few
          friends of his in Kentucky. Mr. CAMERON objected upon the
          ground that one of these persons was named SMITH, and
          used to be a New York Street Commissioner. Any man who
          had been a New York Street Commissioner ought to be
          hanged as soon as any decent pretext could be found for
          hanging him. (Murmurs of approbation from the New York
          reporters.) Still this was not his main objection to
          SMITH. The SMITH family had furnished more aid and
          comfort to the rebel army than any other family in the
          South. No SMITH should, with his consent, be permitted to
          participate in the conduct of a Government which so many
          SMITHS had conspired to overthrow. Moreover, this was an
          incorrigible SMITH. It was an undisputed fact that SMITH
          had given up a lucrative office to follow his political
          convictions. Such a man could not be viewed by Senators
          with any other feelings than those of horror and disgust.
          Let them reflect what would be the effect of polluting
          this body, as by this bill it was proposed to make it
          possible to do, with a man so dead to all the common
          feelings of our nature that he would set up his own
          conceits against the practice of his fellow-Senators, and
          the rewards of a grateful country. This settled the fate
          of SMITH, but the rest of Mr. McCREERY's friends, being
          obscure persons, were let in, in spite of the "barbaric
          yaup" of DRAKE, who said that the next thing would be a
          proposition to enact a similar outrage in Missouri, and
          thereby abet the efforts of the bold bad men who were
          trying to get him out of his seat.</p>

          <p><b>HOUSE.</b></p>

          <p>SCHENCK insisted upon the Tariff. He had been visited
          by delegations from the great heart of the nation, who
          assured him that the great heart of the nation yearned
          for an immediate increase of the duty on various articles
          which competed with the articles manufactured by the
          members of the delegation. No longer ago than yesterday a
          manufacturer of double-back-action jack-planes had
          assured him that the single-forward-action jack-planes
          poured upon our shores by the pauper labor of Europe,
          were, so to speak, shaving off the edge of the national
          life. A gentleman whose name was known to the uttermost
          parts of the civilized world, who had shed new lustre
          upon the American name by the great boon he had bestowed
          upon mankind in the American self-filling rotary Bird of
          Freedom inkstand with revolving lid, had said, with the
          tears of patriotic shame and sorrow in his eyes, that
          there were recreant writers who preferred to purchase the
          Birmingham inkstand, which required to be filled, did not
          rotate, and had no revolution to its lid, at fifty cents,
          than to secure his own triumph of American ingenuity at
          ten dollars. Such misguided men must be taught their duty
          to their native land. Mr. SCHENCK moved an increase to
          4,000 per cent, <i>ad valorem</i> on the foreign
          jack-plane, which he characterized as a Tool of Tyranny,
          and the Birmingham inkstand. The thing was done.</p>

          <p>Mr. DAWES said he was disgusted. Everybody's jobs were
          put through except his. He threatened to go home and tell
          his constituents.</p>

          <p>Mr. PETERS suggested that Mr. DAWES had better go out
          and take "suthin' soothin'." (Mr. PETERS is from Maine,
          and his remark will probably be understood there.) If he
          might be pardoned the liberty he would recommend a little
          ice in it.</p>

          <p>Mr. DAWES said he could do his own drinking. As for
          PETERS, he scorned him. Moreover, PETERS was
          one-eyed.</p>

          <p>Mr. PETERS appealed to his record to show that he had
          two eyes. He did not understand the anger of Mr. DAWES.
          Of course when he suggested a drink, he assumed the
          responsibility of paying for it.</p>

          <p>Mr. DAWES said that altered the case entirely. He took
          pleasure in withdrawing his hasty remarks, and in
          assuring the House that he profoundly venerated PETERS,
          and that PETERS had two perfect eyes of unusual
          expressiveness.</p>

          <p>Mr. BINGHAM called attention to the case of Mr.
          PORTER, who had been smitten on the nose by a vile
          creature whom he declined to drink with. This was a blow
          at the national life, and he thought the punishment of
          treason was imperatively demanded.</p>

          <p>Mr. BUTLER said he had been kicked once. He assured
          the House that the sensation was repugnant to his
          feelings as a man&#8212;much more as a Congressman.
          He moved to amend by substituting slow torture.</p>

          <p>It was finally resolved to put the wretch in irons and
          feed him on bread and water.</p><br>

          geologists to be at the rate of $1.50 <i>per diem</i>.
          Why should these learned geologists waste their time for
          a compensation so mean? Let them rather convert their
          surveying-staffs into ox-goads, and turn their attention
          to Gee-haw-logy,&#8212;'twill pay better than t'other

          <p>The following paragraph, cut from a newspaper,
          suggests a good deal:</p>

          <p>"A Hindoo cabby, before mounting the box and taking
          the reins, always first prays that his driving may be to

          <p>Now this is precisely what the New York hackman
          invariably does before he gathers up the reins and urges
          on his "galled jades." He curses his horses, his
          passengers, and his own eyes, and thus commends his
          driving to the glory of <i>his</i> God, whose other name
          is LUCIFER.</p><br>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
