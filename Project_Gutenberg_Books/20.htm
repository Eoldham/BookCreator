      <p><b>THE MYSTERY OF MR. E. DROOD</b>.</p>
      <p>AN ADAPTATION.</p>
      <p>BY ORFHEUS C. KERR</p>
      <p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>
      <p>THE H. AND H. OF J. BUMSTEAD.</p>
      <p>The exquisitely sweet month of the perfectly delicious
summer-vacation having come, Miss CAROWTHERS' Young Ladies have
returned again, for a time, to their respective homes, MAGNOLIA
PENDRAGON has gone to the city and her brother, and FLORA POTTS is
ridiculously and absurdly alone.</p>
      <p>Under the ardent sun of August, Bumsteadville slowly bakes,
like an ogre's family-dish of stuffed cottages and greens, with here
and there some slowly moving object, like a loose vegetable on a
sluggish current of tidal gravy, and the spire of the Ritualistic
church shooting-up at one end like an incorrigibly perpendicular leg of
magnified mutton.</p>
      <p>Hotter and hotter comes the breath fiery of nature's cookery,
until some of the stuffing boils out of one cottage, in the shape of
the Oldest Inhabitant, who makes his usual annual remark, that this is
the Warmest Day in ninety-eight years, and then simmers away to some
cooler nook amongst the greens. More and more intolerably quivers the
atmosphere of the sylvan oven with stifling fervency, until there oozes
from beneath the shingled crust of a vegetarian country-boarding-house
a parboiled guest from the City, who, believing himself almost ready to
turn, drifts feebly to where the roads fork and there is a shade more
dun; while, to the speculative mind, each glowing field of corn, or
buckwheat, is an incipient Meal, and each chimney, or barn, a mere
temptation to guess how many Swallows there may be in it.</p>
      <p>Upon the afternoon of such a day as this, Miss POTTS is
informed, by a servant, that Mr. BUMSTEAD has arrived, and, sending her
his love, would be pleased to have her come down stairs to him and
bring him a fan.</p>
      <p>"Why didn't you tell him I wasn't at home, you absurd thing?"
cries the young girl, hurriedly practicing a series of agitated looks
and pensive smiles before her mirror.</p>
      <p>"So I did, Miss," answers the attached menial, "but he'd seen
you looking at him with an opera-glass as he came up the path, and said
that he could hear you taking a clean handkerchief out of tho drawer,
on purpose to receive him with, before he'd got to the door."</p>
      <p>"Oh, what shall I do? My hands are so red to-day!" sighs
FLCKA, holding her arms above her head, that the blood may retire from
the too pinkish members.</p>
      <p>After a pause, and an adjustment of a curl over her right eye
and the scarf at her waist, to make them look innocent, she yields to
the meteorological mania so strikingly prevalent amongst all the other
characters of this narrative, and says that she will receive the
visitor in the yard, near the pump. Then, casting carelessly over her
shoulder that web-like shawl without which no woman nor spider is
complete, she arranges her lips in the glass for the last time, and,
with a garden-hat hanging from the elbow latest singed, goes down,
humming un-suspiciously, into the open-air, with the guileless bearing
of one wholly unprepared for company.</p>
      <p>Resting an elbow upon a low iron patent-pump, near a rustic
seat, the Ritualistic organist, in his vast linen coat and imposing
straw hat, looks not unlike an eccentric garden statue, upon which some
prudish slave of modern conventionalities has placed the summer attire
of a western editor. The great heat of the sun upon his back makes him
irritable, and when Miss POTTS sharply smites with her fan the knuckles
of the hand which he has affably extended to take her by the chin, more
than the usual symptoms of acute inflammation appear at the end of his
nose, and he blows hurriedly upon his wounded digits.</p>
      <p>"That hurt like the mischief!" he remarks, in some anger. "I
don't know when I've felt anything smart so."</p>
      <p>"Then don't be so horrid," returns the pensive girl, taking a
seat before him upon the rustic settee, and abstractedly arranging her
dress so that only two-thirds of a gaiter-boot can be seen.</p>
      <p>Munching cloves, the aroma of which ladens the air all around
him, Mr. BUMSTEAD contemplates her with a calmness which would be
enthralling, but for the nervous twisting of his features under the
torments of a singularly adhesive fly.</p>
      <p>"I have come, dear," he observes, slowly, "to know how soon
you will be ready for me to give you your next music-lesson?"</p>
      <p>"I prefer that you would not call me your 'dear,'" was the
chilling answer.</p>
      <p>The organist thinks for a moment, and then nods his head
intelligently. "You are right," he says, gravely, "&#8212;there <i>might</i>
be somebody listening who could not enter into our real feelings. And
now, how about those music-lessons?"</p>
      <p>"I don't want any more, thank you," says FLORA, coldly. "While
we are all in mourning for our poor, dear absurd EDDY, it seems like a
perfectly ridiculous mockery to be practicing the scales."</p>
      <p>Fanning himself with his straw hat, Mr. BUMSTEAD shakes his
bushy head several times. "You do not discriminate sufficiently," he
replies. "There are kinds of music which, when performed rapidly upon
the violin, fife, or kettle-drum, certainly fill the mind with
sentiments unfavorable to the deeper anguish of human sorrow. Of such,
however, is not the kind made by young girls, which is at all times a
help to the intensity of judicious grief. Let me assure you, with the
candor of an idolized friend, that some of the saddest hours of my life
have been spent in teaching you to try to sing a humorous aria from
DONIZETTI; and the moments in which I have most sincerely regretted
ever having been born were those in which you have played, in my
hearing, the Drinking-song from <i>La Traviata</i>. Believe me, then,
my devoted pupil, there can be nothing at all inconsistent with a
prevalence of profound melancholy in your continued piano-playing;
whereas, on the contrary, your sudden and permanent cessation might at
least surprise your friends and the neighborhood into a
light-heartedness temporarily oblivious of the memory of that dear,
missing boy, to whom you could not, I hear, give the love already
bestowed upon me."</p>
      <p>"I loved him ridiculously, absurdly, with my whole heart,"
cries FLORA, not altogether liking what she has heard. "I'm real sorry,
too, that they think somebody has killed him."</p>
      <p>Mr, BUMSTEAD folds his brown linen arms as he towers before
her, and the dark circles around his eyes appear to shrink with the
intensify of his gaze.</p>
      <p>"There are occasions in life," he remarks, "when to
acknowledge that our last meeting with a friend, who has since
mysteriously disappeared, was to reject him and imply a preference for
his uncle, may be calculated to associate us unpleasantly with that
disappearance, in the minds of the censorious, and invite suspicions
tending to our early cross-examination by our Irish local magistrate. I
do not say, of course, that you actually destroyed my nephew for fear
he should try to prejudice me against you; but I cannot withhold my
earnest approval of your judicious pretence of a sentiment palpably
incompatible with the shedding of the blood of its departed object. If
you will move your dress a little, so that I can sit beside you and
allow your head to rest upon my shoulder, that fan will do for both of
us, and we may converse in whispers."</p>
      <p>"My head upon <i>your</i> shoulder!" exclaims Miss POTTS,
staring swiftly about to see if anybody is looking. "I prefer to keep
my head upon my own shoulders, sir."</p>
      <p>"Two heads are better than one," the Ritualistic organist
reminds her. "If a little hair-oil and powder <i>does</i> come off
upon my coat, the latter will wash, I suppose. Come, dearest, if it is
our fate to never get through this hot day alive, let us be sunstruck
together."</p>
      <p>She shrinks timidly from the brown linen arm which he begins
insinuating along the back of the rustic settee, and tells him that she
couldn't have believed that he could be so absurd. He draws back his
arm, and seems hurt.</p>
      <p>"FLORA," he says, tenderly, "how beautiful you are, especially
when fixed up. The more I see of yon, the less sorry I am that I have
concluded to be yours. All the time that my dear boy was trying to
induce you to relase him from his engagement, I was thinking how much
better you might do; yet, beyond an occasional encouraging wink, I
never gave the least sign of reciprocating your attachment. I did not
think it would be right"</p>
      <p>The assertion, though superficially true, is so imperfect in
its delineation of habitual conduct liable to another construction,
that the agitated Flowerpot returns, with quick indignation, "your arm
was always reaching out whenever you sat in a chair anywhere near me,
and whenever I sang you always kept looking straight into my mouth
until it tickled me. You know you did, you hateful thing! Besides, it
wasn't you that I preferred, at all; it was&#8212;oh, it's too ridiculous to
tell!"</p>
      <p>In her bashful confusion she is about to arise and trip shyly
away from him into the house, when he speaks again.</p>
      <p>"Miss POTTS, is your friendship for Miss PENDRAGON and her
brother such, that their execution upon some Friday of next month would
be a spectacle to which you could give no pleased attention?"</p>
      <p>"What do you mean, you absurd creature?"</p>
      <p>"I mean," continues Mr. BUMSTEAD, "simply this: you know my
double loss. You know that, upon the person of the male PENDRAGON was
found an apple looking and tasting like one which my nephew once had.
You know, that when Miss PENDRAGON went from here she wore an alpaca
waist which looked as though it had been exposed more than once to the
rain.&#8212;See the point?"</p>
      <p>FLORA gives a startled look, and says: "I don't see it."</p>
      <p>"Suppose," he goes on&#8212;"suppose that I go to a magistrate, and
say: 'Judge, I voted for you, and can influence a large foreign vote
for you again. I have lost a nephew who was very fond of apples, and a
black alpaca umbrella of great value. A young Southerner, who has not
lived in this State long enough to vote, has been found in possession
of an apple singularly like the kind generally eaten by my missing
relative, and his sister has come out in a waist made of second-hand
alpaca?'&#8212;See the point now?"</p>
      <p>"Mr. BUMSTEAD," exclaims FLORA, affrighted by the terrible
menace of his manner, "I don't any more believe that Mr. PENDRAGON is
guilty than I, myself, am; and as for your old umbrella&#8212;"</p>
      <p>"Stop, woman!" interrupted the bereaved organist, imperiously.
"Not even your lips shall speak disrespectfully of my lost bone-handled
friend. By a chain of unanswerable argument, I have shown you that I
hold the fate of your southern acquaintances in my hands, and shall be
particularly sorry if you force me to hang Mr. PENDRAGON as a rival."</p>
      <p>FLORA puts her hands to her temples, to soothe her throbbing
head and display a bracelet.</p>
      <p>"Oh, what shall I do! I don't want anybody to be hung! It must
be so perfectly awful!"</p>
      <p>Her touching display of generous feeling does not soften him.
On the contrary, he stands more erect, and smiles rather triumphantly
under his straw hat.</p>
      <p>"Beloved one," he murmurs, in a rich voice, "I find that I
cannot induce you to make the first advance toward the mutual avowal we
are both longing for, and must therefore precipitate our happiness
myself. My poor boy would not have given you perfect satisfaction, and
your momentary liking for the male PENDRAGON was but the effect of a
temporary despair undoubtedly produced by my seeming coldness. That
coldness had nothing to do with my heart, but resulted partially from
my habit of wearing a wet towel on my head. I now propose to you&#8212;"</p>
      <p>"Propose to me?" ejaculates Miss POTTS, with heightened color.</p>
      <p>"&#8212;That you pick out a worthy man belonging to your own section
of the Union," he continues hastily. "Here's my Heart," he adds, going
through the motions of taking something from a pocket and placing it in
his outstretched palm, "and here's my Hand,"&#8212;placing therein an equally
imaginary object from another pocket.&#8212;"Try the H. and H. of J.
BUMSTEAD."</p>
      <p>His manner is as though he were commending some patent article
of unquestionable utility.</p>
      <p>"But I can't bear the sight of you!" she cries, pushing away
the brown linen arm coming after her again.</p>
      <p>Taking away her fan, he pats her on the head with it, and
seems momentarily surprised at the hollow sound.</p>
      <p>"Future Mrs. BUMSTEAD," he cheerfully replies, at last, "my
observation and knowledge of the women of America teach me that there
never was a wife going to Indiana for a divorce, who had not at first
sworn to love, as well as honor and obey, her husband. Such is woman
that if she had felt and said at the altar that she couldn't bear the
sight of him, it wouldn't have been in the power of masculine brutality
and dissipated habits to drive her from his side through all their
lives. There can be no better sign of our future happiness, than for
you to say, beforehand, that you utterly detest the man of your choice."</p>
      <p>There is something terrible to the young girl in the original
turn of thought of this fascinating man. Say what she may, he at once
turns it into virtual devotion to himself. He appears to have a
perfectly dreadful power to hang everybody; he considers her strongest
avowal of present personal dislike the most promising indication she
can give of eternal future infatuation with him, and his powerful mode
of reasoning is more profound and composing than an article in a New
York newspaper on a War in Europe. Rendered dizzy by his metaphysical
conversation, she arises from the rustic seat, and is flying giddily
into the house, when he leaps athletically after her, and catches her
in the doorway.</p>
      <p>"I merely wish to request," he says, quietly, "that you place
sufficient restraint upon your naturally happy feelings to keep our
engagement a secret from the public at present, as I can't bear to have
boys calling out after me, 'There's the feller that's goin' to get
married! There's the feller that's goin' to get married!' When a man is
about to make a fool of himself, it is not for children to remind him
of it."</p>
      <p>The door being opened before she can answer, FLORA receives a
parting bow of Grandisonian elegance from Mr. BUMSTEAD, and hastens up
stairs to her room in a distraction of mind not uncommon to those
having conversational relations with the Ritualistic organist.</p>

required to pitch into it, we announce, with a flourish, that Miss L.

Considered as a Disease, she proposes to find the Cause and the Cure.
Considered as a living and gigantic Nuisance (by far surpassing any
Dragon described by SPENSER,) she designs to hunt him out and slay him
incontinently.</p>
      <p>Courage, fair Knight! Our eldest Son is kept in reserve for
some such Heroine! If you would be famous, if you would make a perfect
thing of this Crusade, if you would render the lives of your fellow
mortals longer and happier, if you would win that noble and ingenuous
youth, our son, go in vehemently!</p>
      <p>And, while you are about it, LILLIAN, would you object to
giving your attention to certain relations of the monster which you
propose to slay? We name them, Detraction and Calumny. They are tough
old Dragons, now, we tell you; perhaps it were best to fight shy of
them.</p>
      <p>We have it, LILLIAN! Leave 'em to us! Us, with a big U! You
kill little Gossip, and see how quick his brothers and sisters will
fall, before our mighty battle-axe!</p>
      <p>(And so they will fall, sure enough, but it will be simply
because when our dear young knight, L.E., has killed <i>her</i>
Dragon, she will have wiped out the whole brood! They can't live
without their sweet and attractive little sister. And so, like many a

back from the seashore, to find the theatres opening, the war closing,
and GREELEY burning to imitate the late French Emperor, by leading the

position to write to the Germanically named HOFFMAN&#8212;"As I cannot fall,

victorious Excellency."</p>
      <p>Being back, I went to see <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> at
NIBLO'S Garden. It was the day when the French CAESER fell, and the
impertinent soothsayer, ROCHEFORT, who had so often advised him to
beware, not of the Ides of March, but of the <i>Id&eacute;es
Napol&eacute;oniennes,</i> (there is a feeble attempt at a pun here)
obtained his liberty, and the right to assail in his newspaper, the
virtue of every female relative of the Imperial family. Of course I
know that JULIUS C&AElig;SAR was not a Frenchman&#8212;for the modesty of his
"Commentaries" is proverbial&#8212;and that SHAKESPEARE never so much as
heard of the Man of December. Nevertheless the two C&AElig;SARS were
inextricably mixed up in my mind. I know that two or three editorial
persons who sat close by me, were continually talking of NAPOLEON, and
I may possibly have confounded their remarks with those of the actors.
Still I could not divest myself of the impression that I was sometimes
in Paris and sometimes in Rome, and that the sepulchral voice of Mr.
THEODORE HAMILTON, was more often that of NAPOLEON than that of JULIUS.
The play presents itself to my recollection in the following shape. As
I said before, it was represented at the very moment that the French
republicans, being satisfied with the bees in their respective bonnets,
were obliterating the imperial bees from the doors of the Tuileries,
and being anxious to take arms against a sea of Prussians, were taking
down the imperial arms wherever they could find them. Remembering this,
the reader will be able to account for any slight difference in text
between my <i>Julius C&aelig;sar,</i> and that of the respectable and
able Mr. SHAKESPEARE.</p>

      <p><b>BY GEORGE!</b></p>
      <p>LAKE GEORGE, August 30.</p>
      <p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO:&#8212;I arrived here last Saturday, and as I would
be the last person to allow a commendable enterprise to languish for
want of proper encouragement, and in order to put the Hotel proprietors
out of suspense, I thought I would let you know without further delay
that I consider Lake George a success.</p>
      <p>Not being expected, as I supposed, I must admit I was somewhat
gratified to find a full band playing on the veranda as the coach I was
in drove up.</p>
      <p>It was a sort of delicate attention, you know.</p>
      <p>I notice, however, that they continue playing in the afternoon
since then, I suppose it struck them as a good idea at the time.</p>
      <p>The Fort William Henry Hotel is a gorgeous affair in every
respect. It is situated very near the old original Fort, just where the
French troops advanced to capture it, and made their celebrated charges.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the present proprietor can't discount them at that
sort of thing.</p>
      <p>Perhaps not!</p>
      <p>Looking over one's bills reminds you a good deal of the Police
Courts, five dollars fine, twenty-five dollars costs.</p>
      <p>The costs they make here are very good, however, altho' they
do put a little too much mint in them, I must say.</p>
      <p>L.G. is all right, though. It is supplied with all the modern
conveniences. It isn't within five minutes walk of the post office, but
its water conveniences are apparent to all. There is no end to its
belles, and as for its ranges, it has two of them&#8212;both Adirondacks.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I took a trip up the Lake and across to its
neighbor, Champlain.</p>
      <p>Everybody takes this trip because its "the thing," and it is
therefore particularly necessary to take it. Ostensibly, you go to view
the scenery, really, to be inveigled into paying for a low comedy of a
dinner at the other end.</p>
      <p>The first place our boat stopped at is called the "Trout
Pavillion," principally, so far as I can learn, on account of the
immense number of pickerel caught there, and from the fact that it is
unquestionably a good site for a Pavillion whenever the esteemed
Proprietor turns up jacks enough, at his favorite game, to build one.</p>
      <p>The next place was set down in the Guide Book as the "Three
Sisters" Islands, an appellation arising from the fact that there are
precisely <i>four</i> of them.</p>
      <p>I mentioned this apparent discrepancy to the boat clerk.</p>
      <p>This young man, who belongs to a Base Ball Club, informs me
that these islands invariably travelled with a "substitute," as one
occasionally got "soaked."</p>
      <p>This certainly seems a little curious, but as the young man
says he was born here, I suppose he knows.</p>
      <p>This same young man pointed out a beautiful spot called Green
Island and asked me if I wouldn't like to live there.</p>
      <p>He said he thought it would just suit me.</p>
      <p>The attention of these people is really delightful.</p>
      <p>Some of these places, however, have very inappropriate names,
for instance another little gem is called "Hog Island." No one knows
why it was so called. The clerk of the boat don't either.</p>
      <p>He wanted to know if I had ever dined there.</p>
      <p>I always make it a point to get on the right side of these
Steamboat fellows, always.</p>
      <p>About half way up the Lake is a place called Tongue Mountain.</p>
      <p>A long time ago a colony of strong-minded women settled there.</p>
      <p>That may have had something to do with its name.</p>
      <p>Nobody ever goes there now.</p>
      <p>People go very near the mountain in boats, however, as it is
noted for something very extraordinary in the Echo line.</p>
      <p>It has what is called a "Double Echo."</p>
      <p>I fully expected something of this kind.</p>
      <p>Now if there is anything I am particularly down on, it is
those unmitigated frauds known as Echoes. And if I ever throw four
sixes, it is when I am tackling some unsuspecting old ass of a watering
place echo.</p>
      <p>I consider them "<i>holler</i> mockeries."</p>
      <p>Of course we steamed within proper distance, and I seized the
opportunity to "put a head on" this venerable two-ply nuisance, as
follows:</p>
      <p>First, I read a page of a Patent Office Report I go armed with.</p>
      <p>This the Echo, with very little hesitation, repeated in
duplicate as usual. From one side of the rock in English, and from the
other in fair French.</p>
      <p>I saw at once that old EK was pretty well filled.</p>
      <p>Next I sang "Listen to the Mocking Bird," which it repeated
very creditably indeed, dropping but two notes on the third verse. This
it made up for, I am bound to admit, by throwing in some original
variations in the chorus.</p>
      <p>But I hadn't played from my sleeve yet, so I recited HAMLET'S
Soliloquy.</p>
      <p>From the wooded slope on our right came the familiar "<i>To be</i>"
of BOOTH, while from the sloping woods on our left proceeded a finely
rendered imitation of the Teutonic FECHTER, in the same.</p>
      <p>This staggered me!</p>
      <p>I had one more jack in my cuff, however. I pulled out a copy
of the Tribune and read a few paragraphs of GREELEY'S "What do I know
about Farming."</p>
      <p><i>That settled him!</i></p>
      <p>He never got to the first semi-colon. It knocked the breath
right out of him!</p>
      <p>The poor old fossil had to quit. He changed his repeater to a
leaver. But then you see he had held the office a good while.</p>
      <p>He hasn't left the business to any one, either.</p>
      <p>In future no one will go fooling round there except the
fishermen. The sign is down.</p>
      <p>In my next I will finish the Lake trip, and give you some
account of the celebrated "Roger's Slide."</p>

      <p>BY MOSE SKINNER.</p>
      <p>POPULARITY.</p>
      <p>Next to talk, popularity is the cheapest thing I know of. It
is achieved by three classes&#8212;those who have brains, those who have
money, and those who have neither. The first earn it; the second buy
it; and the third stumble into it, perhaps by waving their hat at an
engineer just in time to prevent the train from dashing over a
precipice, or by chopping off somebody's head with a meat axe and
burning the remains up afterwards, in which case the next day's paper
gives a faithful account of their pedigree, and their photograph can be
purchased at any respectable news-dealers, at a price within reach of
all.</p>
      <p>The most common-place sayings of popular men are handed down
to posterity, and a casual remark about the weather is often framed and
hung up in the spare-bedroom.</p>
      <p>It behooves every public man to keep a sentence or two on
hand, with a view to embalming them for future reference. I wish to
state, in confidence, that if any prominent man who can't think of
anything that sounds well, will address me, I will furnish him at the
low price of one dollar a sentence. My stock is entirely fresh and
original, and embraces such gems as&#8212;"Don't give up the ship," "Such is
Life," "How's this for high?" "I die happy," "A stitch in time saves
nine," &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
      <p>I am also prepared to furnish "last words of eminent men," at
a moderate compensation.</p>
      <p>General GRANT has taken time by the forelock in this matter.
His "Let us have Peace," was a most brilliant effort, because nobody
ever thought of it before. "I propose to move on your works
immediately, if it takes all summer," was also a happy thought.</p>
      <p>When General GRANT was in Boston he said he liked the way they
made gravy in Massachusetts. Now this in itself would not, perhaps, be
called deep, because others have said the same thing before, but,
coming from a man like GRANT, it set folks to thinking, and it is not
surprising that something of this sort went the rounds:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">We have the best authority for
stating that General GRANT, during his recent visit to Boston, remarked
that he was gratified at the manner in which gravy was produced in
Massachusetts. Our talented Chief Magistrate is a man of few words, but
what he does say is spicy, and to the point."</p>
      <p>At the Peace Jubilee, GRANT said he "liked the cannon best;"
but the reporters, being confidentially informed that the remark wasn't
intended for posterity, it didn't get out much. I didn't hear of his
saying anything else.</p>
      <p>If a popular man takes cold, the whole public sneeze. His
opinions must go into the papers any how, though perhaps no better than
anybody's else. Thus&#8212;from a daily paper:</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 40px;">"The Hon. MONTGOMERY BLAIR recently
said in a private conversation, that the present war would probably end
in victory for the Prussians, and the overthrow of Napoleon."</p>
      <p>Supposing he did? I heard JOHN SMITH say the same thing in an
eating saloon over a month ago, and out of twenty gentlemen present,
four were reporters, but they didn't take out their note books in
breathless haste and put down the Hon. JOHN SMITH'S opinion, how Mr.
SMITH looked when he said it, and if he said it as though he really
meant it, and in a manner that thrilled his listeners.</p>
      <p>But JOHN hasn't any popularity, you see, and the Hon.
MONTGOMERY has&#8212;though it may be a little mildewed.</p>
      <p>Soon after the war, I wrote an article on the Alabama Claims.
It was a masterly effort, and cost me a month's salary to get it
inserted in a popular magazine. If that article had proved a success, I
could easily have gulled the public all my life on the popularity thus
achieved.</p>
      <p>But I made a wretched mistake to start with. Instead of
heading it "The Alabama Claims," "By CHARLES SUMNER," or "HORACE
GREELEY." I said "By MOSE SKINNER."</p>
      <p>I will not dwell on the result. Suffice it to say that I soon
after retired from literature, a changed being, utterly devoid of hope.</p>
      <p>MORAL SUASION.</p>
      <p>A friend of mine, an eminent New York philanthropist, relates
the following interview with a condemned criminal. The crime for which
this wretched man was hung is still fresh in our memories. One morning
at breakfast his tripe didn't suit him, and he immediately brained his
wife and children and set the house on fire, varying the monotony of
the scene by pitching his mother-in-law down the well, having
previously, with great consideration, touched her heart with a cheese
knife.</p>
      <p>I will now quote my friends' own words:</p>
      <p>"He was pronounced a hard case, manifesting no sorrow for his
act, and utterly indifferent to his approaching doom. A score of good
people had visited him with the kindest intentions, but without making
the smallest impression upon him.</p>
      <p>"Without boasting, I wish to say that I knew I could touch
this man's heart. I saw a play once in which the most blood-thirsty and
brutal ruffian that ever existed was melted to tears at the mention of
his mother's name, and childhood's happy hours, and everybody knows
that what happens on the stage happens just the same in real life.</p>
      <p>"I naturally congratulated myself on having seen this play,
for it gave me power to cope with this relentless disposition.</p>
      <p>"He resisted all attempts at conversation, however, in the
most dogged manner, barely returning surly monosyllables to my anxious
wishes for his well being.</p>
      <p>"At last, laying my hand on his shoulder, and throwing
considerable pathos into my voice, I said:</p>
      <p>"My friend, it was not always thus with you. There was a time
when you sat upon your mother's knee, and gathered buttercups and
daisies?"</p>
      <p>"Ah! I had touched the right chord at last. His brow
contracted and his lips twitched convulsively."</p>
      <p>"And when that mother put you in your little bed," I
continued, "she kissed you, and hoped you would grow up a&#8212;"</p>
      <p>"You lie," said he, "she didn't. The old woman was six foot
under ground afore I could chaw. Now, look a here, you're the fourth
chap that's tried the 'mother' dodge on me. Why don't you fellers" he
added with a malicious grin, "go back on the mother business, and give
the old man a chance, jest for a change?"</p>
      <p>"After the above scurvy treatment I was naturally anxious to
witness the man's funeral, which I understood was to be a gorgeous
affair, six respectably-attired females having been sworn in to kiss
the body, amid the hysteric weeps of three more in the background."</p>

      <p><b>COMIC ZOOLOGY.</b></p>
      <p>Genus, Phoca.&#8212;The Seal.</p>
      <p>This is the common name of the inoffensive and fur-bearing
members of the Phocid&aelig; family. The word seal is derived,
radically, from the German <i>Siegel,</i> so that to say a man has
"fought mit SIEGEL," is equivalent to remarking that he has assailed a
harmless and timid seal.</p>
      <p>The Phocid&aelig;, without distinction of sex, are known as
Mammafers, although it would manifestly be more correct to call the
males Papafers. Under the present classification, the confusion of
genders necessarily engenders confusion.</p>
      <p>Unless AGASSIZ is gassing us, the true seal has no sign of an
ear, wherefore the deafening roar of the surf in which it delights to
sport is probably no inconvenience to it. As distinguished from dumb
beasts in general, it may properly be called a deaf and dumb animal.
The false seal, on the contrary, has as true an ear as e'er was seen.
To the counterfeits belong the sea lion, the Mane specimen of the tribe
in the Arctic sea, and the sea leopard, which seems to be phocalized in
the Antarctic circle. All the varieties of the seal seek concealment in
caverns, and their Hides are much sought after.</p>
      <p>Sealing was at one time chiefly monopolized by adventurous New
Englanders, who combined the pursuit with whaling, but at present the
sealers of Salt Lake bear off the palm from all competitors, both as
regards numbers and hardihood. Whether they combine whaling with
sealing is not positively known, but probably they do. Such is the
universal passion for sealing among the people of that region, that the
old men act like Young men when engaged in this exciting occupation.</p>
      <p>The Phocid&aelig; appear to have attracted the attention of
Mankind at a very early period&#8212;Seals being frequently spoken of in the
Scriptures. St. JOHN witnessed the opening of no less than seven
varieties, and must have been well acquainted with their internal
structure.</p>
      <p>The earless, or true species, are often seen in considerable
numbers on the British coast, and the Great Seal of England&#8212;only to be
found in the vicinity of the Thames&#8212;is of such remarkable size and
weight, that it never makes its appearance without producing a strong
Impression.</p>
      <p>The Green Seal, a much admired variety, is peculiar to
Madeira, and seals of various colors are often seen in close proximity
to the British. Ports; the number taken off Cork being prodigious.</p>
      <p>None of the animals of the Phoca genus are tenacious of life.
They may readily be destroyed with sealing whacks. A large stick
properly applied has been known to seal the fate of a dozen in the
space of half an hour. KANE knocked them over without difficulty, and
they never attempt to defend themselves, according to PANEY.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, it may be remarked that immense herds of seals
cover the coasts of Alaska. It is nevertheless difficult to catch a
glimpse of them, on account of the enormous flocks of humming birds,
which darken the air in that genial clime. Occasionally, however, the
Arctic zephyrs disperse the feathery cloud, and then vast numbers of
the timid creatures, with a sprinkling of the Walrus, may be seen by
looking in a Se(a)ward direction.</p>

      <p><b>A LITTLE ACKNOWLEDGMENT.</b></p>
      <p>The <i>Free (and Easy) Press</i> has honored PUNCHINELLO with
a brief as well as premature obituary paragraph. Flattered as he is by
being thus noticed in the columns of a journal of the long standing and
well sustained popularity of the <i>Free (and Easy) Press</i>, it
pains PUNCHINELLO to be obliged to state that he still lives, and that
he is not only alive, but kicking. That he has come to an end, is
true&#8212;but it is to the end of his First Volume, as the <i>F. (and E.)
Press</i> can see by turning to the admirably written, dashing,
humorous, and absolutely unsurpassable Index appended to our present
number, which Index PUNCHINELLO cordially recommends to the perusal of
the <i>F. (and E.) Press</i>. The Preface to his Second Volume,
however, which is now in preparation, will, PUNCHINELLO confidently
assures the <i>F. (and E.) Press</i>, be altogether superior to the
Index to his First. Let the <i>F. (and E.) Press</i> look out for it.
But, meanwhile, the <i>F. (and E.) Press</i> can cheer itself by
frequent contemplation of the entertaining personage who serves as
tail-piece to the Index, and whose gesture is of that familiar and
suggestive kind that will doubtless be thoroughly understood by the <i>F.
(and E.) Press</i>, and, as PUNCHINELLO hopes, fully appreciated.</p>

      <p><b>HIRAM GREEN IN WALL STREET.</b></p>
      <p>His Celebrated Speech before the Board or Brokers.&#8212;A few Words
of Sound Advice from the Squire.</p>
      <p>Doorin' a breef sojern in the Emperor City, a deputation of
Wall Street brokers and smashers called and invited me to make a speech
afore the members of their church, whose <i>Sin</i>-agog is situated
in Brod Street.</p>
      <p>Thinks I, if I can make these infatuated worshippers of the
Golden Calf, Mammon, see the error of their ways and take a back track,
me thunk my chances for the White House would be full as flatterin' as
Sisters WOODHUL, GEORGIANA FRANCIS TRAIN, or any other woman, in '72.</p>
      <p>Layin' off my duster, and adjustin' my specturcals, at the
appinted hour, I slung the follerin' extemperaneous remarks at 'em:</p>
      <p>My infatuated friends and Goverment Bondmen:</p>
      <p>As an ex-statesman which has served his country for 4 years as
Gustise of the Peece, raisin' said offis to a hire standard than usual,
to say nothin' about raisin' an interestin' family of eleven morril an
hily intellectooal children, I rise and git up, ontramelled by any
politikle alliances, to say: that when you fellers git on a mussy fit,
like the old woman who undertook to pick her chickens by runnin' them
through a patent hash cutter, you make the feathers fly, and leave your
victims in a hily clawed up stait.</p>
      <p>Perfesser ARKIMIDEES, of Oxford, (and here allow me to stait,
so as to avoid newspaper contraryversy, as in the case of DISRALLY'S
novel Lothere, <i>I have no refference to</i> T. GOLDWIN SMITH <i>whatsomever</i>,
as I believe ARKIMIDEES is now dead,) said he could raise the hul earth
with a top section of a rale fence, if he could only find something
tangible to rest his timber on.</p>
      <p>My friends, that man had never heerd of Wall Street, and I'de
bet all the money I can borrer on it.</p>
      <p>With such a prop as this ere little territory, where games of
chance are "entered into accordin' to the act of Congress," to cote
from a familiar passage in every printed copy of PUNCHINELLO, the
Perfesser could have raised this little hemisfeer quicker than any of
you chaps can gobble up a greenhorn.</p>
      <p>And, sirs, I'me sorry to be obliged to speak plain, it would
be a darned site more to your credit if you'd try and raise the earth,
instead of daily usin' Wall Street as a base of operations to raise
H----, well&#8212;excuse me, the futer asilum for retired brokers.</p>
      <p>How do you manage, when you want to make a steak?</p>
      <p>You run up stocks and produce a crysis.</p>
      <p>Outsiders rush in lickety smash, and invest all the money they
can rake and scrape, in these inflated stocks. Suddenly you prick the
bubble, when, alas! besides the cry-sis, there's more cry-bubs in and
about Wall Street than there was in Egipt, when NAPOLEON BONAPART
chopped off the heads off all the first born. Instances have been
known, where a good many of you chaps have rammed your head in the
Tiger's mouth once too often.</p>
      <p>If my memry serves me correctly, FISKE and GOOLD made you
perambulate off on your eyebrows, last fall, and while the a-4-said
Tigers walked off with the seats of your trowserloons in their teeth,
you all jined in the follerin' him:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span

      </div>
      <p>Another little dodge of your'n, my misguided friends, is to
keel off K. VANDERBILT.</p>
      <p>What did you do t'other day?</p>
      <p>Why, when KERNELIUS was engaged in a friendly game of cards
for <i>keeps</i>, up at Saratogy, some poor deluded <i>money</i>-maniac
telegrafs that the Commodore had at last found his match, and had been
gathered to his fathers. While at the bottom of the dispatch was forged
the name of my friend, KISSLEBURGH, city editor of the <i>Troy Times</i>,
who, up to the present time, if this coot knows herself, hain't bin
into the hiway robbin' bizziness, not by a long shot. But, my friends
and feller citizens, old VAN is sharper that a two-edged gimlet.</p>
      <p>When he lays down his wallet among a lot of other calf skins,
like a great sponge in a puddle of water, it sucks every square inch of
legal tender, which is in suckin' distance.</p>
      <p>For a regler 40 hoss power suction, K. VANDERBILT is your man.
I ones thought I could never take a locker to this 'ere honest old
heart, but as I cast my gaze over this audience, and observe among the
Bulls and Bears, a cuple of Dears, I will retract that, payin' in the
follerin' <i>Jew de spree</i>:</p>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <span
 style="margin-left: 1.25em;">Come rest on this buzzum,</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.25em;">Oh! butiful broker,</span><br>

little breeze, in the midst of which the pretty brokers blushed and
looked so bewitchin' like, that it was enuff to make a feller throw
stuns at K. VANDERBILT if the pretty Dears only wanted him to.)</p>
      <p>I agin resoomed:</p>
      <p>My infatuated friends; afore I wind up, let me give you a few
partin' words of advice.</p>
      <p>Give up this 'ere gamblin' bizziness. When you run up gold it
hits the hul mercantile body of this nation a wipe in the stummuck. A
good many little cubs, as well as a few ole Bears, have been gobbled up
by your confounded efforts at runnin' up gold, while you grin and
chuckle like the laffin' hyena, when ransackin' Navy Yards and whisky
distilleries. But, if you insist on goin' ahead and earnin' your daily
peck by smashin' things and layin' out the onsofisticated, all I have
got to say is, that next time you've got a <i>sure thing</i> to make a
speck, by telegrafin' me at Skeensboro, I won't mind comin' down and
takin' a hand in, if my pocketin' a few hundred thousands will be the
means of betterin' your morrils, by my sharin' your burden. In
concloosion, feller citizens, feelin' in rather a poetical mood to-day,
I will close with the follerin' tribute to Wall Street and its
inhabitants:</p>

      <p><b>PUNCHINELLO AS A "SAVANT."</b></p>
      <p>MR. PUNCHINELLO: I have always taken a profound interest in
Science. When a child my fond parents observed in me a decided taste
for Entomology, the wings and legs of butterflies and grasshoppers
being the objects of my special investigation. As a school-boy I
obtained (despite the frequent closing of my visual organs)
considerable Insight into Physical Science in the course of numerous
pugilistic encounters. A close Application to Optics at that time
enabled me to get some Light on the Subject.</p>
      <p>I was quite a phenomenon in Astronomy. While yet an unweaned
infant I made numerous observations on the Milky Way, and when learning
to walk frequently saw stars undiscernable with the most powerful
telescope. Since my arrival at man's estate I have frequently
experimented on the Elasticity of the Precious Metals, but have
generally found it extremely difficult to make both ends meet.</p>
      <p>Considering, therefore, that I had as just a claim to be
called scientific, as many who pretend to be <i>Savants</i>, I
determined to attend the late Scientific Convention at Troy. My
reception was most gratifying. On presenting my credentials to the
Convention, that learned body welcomed me with open arms, and I was
escorted to a place among the members by its distinguished head.</p>
      <p>Some of the speculations of these eminent philosophers were
exceedingly profound, and it is really wonderful, Mr. PUNCHINELLO, to
what an extent theory may be carried in the advance of science.</p>
      <p>Mr. GOOSEFELT read a learned and original paper&#8212;carefully
compiled from various sources&#8212;on the Steam Engine, in the course of
which he stated that his great aunt, who had been blown up on the first
steamboat that ever went down in the Mississippi, during the great
Earthquake of 1811, was still living. Also, that his godfather, the
celebrated Mr. NICODEMUS, assisted (probably in the interests of
science) in pulling down the statue of GEORGE III in the Bowling Green.
The importance of these two facts cannot be over-estimated, as they
will undoubtedly give a tremendous impulse to the wheels of science.</p>
      <p>Professor GREYWACKE, the eminent Geologist, delivered an
address on Natural Petrifactions, indicating the various specimens of
Ancient Fossils by which he was surrounded, and describing their
formation. The audience was probably Petrified with astonishment at the
immense learning and research he displayed, for it observed a Stony
silence, only interrupted by an occasional snore.</p>
      <p>A brilliant paper on the Illuminating Power of Gas was read by
Professor M.T. HEAD. It was a most Luminous production, and proved
conclusively that an immense expenditure of gas sometimes throws very
little Light on any Subject. The Professor is thoroughly versed in
Meters, and is the author of the "Volume of Gas" which has attracted so
much attention in the scientific world.</p>
      <p>Professor SUETT addressed the Scientists on the Effect of
Tallow upon Ox(h)ides. From certain experiments made by him it appears
that the Oleaginous principle is incompatible with Water, and
unfavorable to the action of rust.</p>
      <p>A member was of the opinion that this important discovery
might be turned to great practical advantage, as the application of
cart grease to rusty iron axles might possibly facilitate the rotary
motion of the wheels.</p>
      <p>This novel and valuable suggestion was hailed with shouts of
applause, and the thanks of the Convention were immediately voted to
the distinguished member, whose name I have unfortunately forgotten.</p>
      <p>Professor HYDRAGE read an Essay on the Transit of Mercury,
which he said would take place in the form of a Bed Precipitate in
1878. It may possibly take place before then, however, as the Faculty
of Medicine are said to be rapidly abandoning the use of calomel.</p>
      <p>The State Conchologist read an extremely interesting
disquisition on the Oyster, which was divided into sections and
literally devoured by the audience. He also exhibited some Specimens of
Conchs, which were regular Sneezers in point of size.</p>
      <p>An announcement which was made by the distinguished
Astronomer, Professor LOONEY, created a most profound sensation.</p>
      <p>He stated that with the aid of a powerful telescope he had
discovered an immense Fissure in the Moon. He was quite positive that
he had also observed a Man in the Gap. Although unable to distinguish
the features of this individual, he thought it might possibly be JAMES
STEPHENS, the missing Fenian Head Centre.</p>
      <p>When the excitement consequent upon this startling
announcement had subsided, I rose and addressed the Convention as
follows:</p>
      <p>"Ladies and Gentlemen: I cannot express, in words, the
profound gratification with which I have listened to the learned and
eloquent addresses which have just been delivered. The advancement of
Science is an object which is worthy the efforts of such distinguished <i>savants</i>
as I see around me, and to this object they have brought that
profundity of learning which is only to be gathered from the perusal of
elementary text books, that almost strabismal acuteness of perception
which enables them to descry such great scientific truths as can be
discovered through an orifice in a barn door, and that wonderful power
of discrimination which enables them to distinguish between the seed of
the leguminous plant known as the bean, and the other vegetable
productions of Nature, when the bag is open.</p>
      <p>As an humble member of the Brotherhood of Science, I desire to
contribute, in however insignificant a degree, to the Great Cause of
Learning. I will therefore, with Your Permission, read" (loud cries of
'No! No!' 'Put him out!' etc., to which of course I paid no attention,)
"the following papers: 'An Inquiry as to Whether Diptheria has anything

      <p>I proceeded to read the first of the above named papers, but
before I had got very far, Mr. PUNCHINELLO, I was interrupted by a
peculiar sound, which I at first took for subdued applause, but which,
on investigation, I found proceeded from the noses of the audience. In
short, Mr. P., both audience and Convention were in a profound slumber.
Considerably mortified, I withdrew in silence. I am determined,
however, that my theses shall not be lost to posterity. I intend to
have them published, and to send you a copy of each.</p>
      <p>Profoundly yours,</p>
      <p>CHINCAPIN.</p>

      <p>We learn that "some of the pear trees in Suffolk County are
now in blossom." Surely such a season as this one for pears has never
before been seen. Who knows but the fact may induce SUSAN B. ANTHONY to
go pairing with some Revolutionary bachelor?</p>

Produced by Cornell University, Joshua Hutchinson, Steve Schulze and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
