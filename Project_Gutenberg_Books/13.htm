          <p><b>PERIODICAL LITERATURE.</b></p>

          <p>PUNCHINELLO has hitherto refrained from criticising
          the periodicals of the day, from the mistaken idea that
          superlative excellence was not expected in every number
          of every daily or weekly journal in the land. He did not
          know that, if every such journal was not edited so as to
          suit the comprehension of all classes of cursory critics,
          it should be unqualifiedly condemned. Supposing that a
          painter should not condemn a paper for publishing a
          musical article beyond his comprehension, and that an
          architect ought not to get in a rage because he finds in
          his favorite journal a paper on beavers which makes him
          feel insignificant, PUNCHINELLO has generally looked
          around upon his fellow-journalists, and thought them very
          good fellows, who generally published very good papers.
          He did not find superlative excellence in any of their
          issues, but then he did not look for it. He might as well
          pretend to look for that in the journalists themselves,
          or in society at large. But he has lately learned, from
          the critics of the period, that he ought to look for it,
          and that it is the proper thing nowadays to pitch into
          every journal which does not, in every part, please every
          body, whether they be smart or dull; those quick of
          appreciation, or those slow gentlemen who always come in
          with their congratulations upon the birth of a joke at
          the time its funeral is taking place. And so, PUNCHINELLO
          will do as others do, and will occasionally view, from
          the loop-hole in his curtain, the successes and failures
          of his neighbors, and will give his patrons the benefit
          of his observations.</p>

          <p>The first thing he notices to-day is, that the
          <i>Evening Snail</i> of last night is not so good as it
          was a fortnight ago; or, let us think a bit&#8212;it
          may have been a good number at the beginning of last
          month that he was thinking of; at all events, this last
          issue is inferior. The matter on the first page is not
          printed in nearly as good type as the original
          periodicals had it, and while the letters in the heading
          are quite fair, it is very noticeable that the I's are
          very defective, and there is no C in it. The "Gleanings"
          are excellent, and it would be advisable to have more of
          them&#8212;if indeed such a thing were possible in
          this case. The spider-work inside shows no acquaintance
          with the writings of BACH or GLIDDON, and there is
          nothing about the Spectrum Analysis in any part of the
          paper. Besides, the paper is too stiff and rattles too
          much, and PUNCHINELLO could never abide the color of the
          editor's pantaloons. Why will not people dress and write
          so that every body can admire and understand them.
          Especially in regard to witty things and breastpins They
          ought to be loud, overpowering, and so glaring that
          people could not help seeing them. And they ought to be a
          little cheap, too, or average people won't comprehend
          them. In both cases paste (and scissors) pays better than
          diamonds. The reports of private parties in the
          <i>Snail</i> are, however, very good, and if it would
          confine its original matter to such subjects, it could
          not fail to succeed.</p><br>

          <p>Boston has a couple of clergymen who have fallen out
          upon matters not precisely theological. In the summer,
          the Rev. Mr. MURRAY leaves his sheep, to shoot deer by
          torchlight in the Adirondacks. This the Rev. Mr. ALGER,
          in addressing the Suppression of Cruelty to Animals
          Society, denounces as extremely wicked. From all which Mr
          PUNCHINELLO, taking up his discourse, infers,</p>

          <p><i>First</i>. That it is a great deal more wicked to
          shoot deer by torchlight than by daylight.</p>

          <p><i>Secondly</i>. That the Rev. MURRAY and the Rev.
          ALGER are of different religious persuasions.</p>

          <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">ALL ABOARD FOR
          HOLLAND</span></p>

          <p>PUNCHINELLO understands that a performance is soon to
          take place at the Academy of Music, for the benefit of
          GEORGE HOLLAND, the well-known and ever-green "veteran"
          of "the stage." It pleases PUNCHINELLO to know that a
          combination of talent and beauty is to be brought
          together for so worthy a purpose. Seventy-four years ago,
          when GEORGE HOLLAND was a small child, PUNCHINELLO used
          to dandle him upon his knee. Hardly four years have
          passed since PUNCHINELLO was convulsed by the <i>Tony
          Lumpkin</i> of HOLLAND. He distinctly remembers, too,
          administering hot whiskey punch to little boy HOLLAND
          with a tea-spoon, which may in some measure account for
          the Spirit subsequently infused by the capital comedian
          into the numerous bits of character presented by him.
          Considering these facts, it is manifestly an incumbent
          duty on the part of PUNCHINELLO to request the earnest
          attention of his readers to the subject of GEORGE
          HOLLAND'S benefit, all particulars concerning which will
          be given due time through the public press. It used to be
          said, long ago, that "the Dutch have taken Holland,"
          Well, let our own modern Knickerbockers improve upon that
          notion, by taking HOLLAND'S tickets. Remember how, in the
          early settlement of the country, it was Holland that made
          New-York, and see that New-York now returns the
          compliment, and makes HOLLAND. Convivial songsters
          frequently remind us that&#8212;</p><span style=
          "margin-left: 1em;">&#8212;"a Hollander's draught
          should potent be,</span><br>
          <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And deep as the rolling
          Zuyder Zee."</span><br>

          <p>Mind this, all ye Hollanders who would give your
          support to our HOLLAND. Let your drafts be potent, your
          cheeks heavy, your attendance punctual. Make the affair
          complete; so that when, here-after, a comparison is
          sought for something that has been a sued people will say
          of it&#8212;"As big as that Bumper of
          HOLLAND'S."</p><br>

          <p>F. Undoubtedly, my child; they began with the first

          <p>F. You are quite right, HELENE; it will. Or say,
          rather, a Sun. For you will observe that it is a
          <i>warm</i> light; not cool, as reflected light always
          is. It is Original.</p>

          <p>D. Well, this shows that PUNCHINELLO must have some
          Heart, as well as Head. Come, put on your highest power
          now, and let us seem to pay good old Tellus a visit!</p>

          <p>F. Now, dear! take a good look.</p>

          <p>D. (<i>Looking intently</i>.) Oh! how splendid&#8212;how
          splendid! <i>Do</i> see the beautiful things in those
          Shop Windows! It must be the Spring Season there!
          <i>Do</i> see those lovely lumps on the backs of those
          creatures' heads! What place is it, Father?</p>

          <p>F. That? It's New-York; and the street is the famous
          Broadway.</p>

          <p>D. O dear! how I <i>would</i> like to go shopping
          there, this minute!&#8212;for I see it is afternoon
          in that quarter. Is there no way of getting there?(!!!)</p>

          <p>F. (<i>Laughing heartily</i>.) Well, well, HELENE!
          That's pretty good, for the daughter of an astronomer! Do
          you know that at this precise moment you are Forty-five
          Million, Six Hundred and Fifty-four Thousand, Four
          Hundred and Ninety-one Miles and a half from those
          Muslins! I'll tell you, Sis, what <i>could</i> be done:
          Drop a line to the Editor of PUNCHINELLO, and tell him
          what you want. He'll get it, some way.</p>

          <p>D. That I will, instantly! [<i>Turns to her portfolio,
          while her father turns to the telescope</i>.]</p>

          <p>"DEAR MR. EDITOR: Pardon the seeming <i>boldness</i> of a
          <i>stranger:</i> you are no <i>stranger to me!</i> Long,
          <i>long</i> have I deceived that <i>good man</i>, my
          father, by <i>pretending</i> to know <i>nothing</i> of
          the Earth, or of his <i>instrument!</i> Many and
          <i>many</i> a night, <i>unknown to him</i>, have I gone
          to the <i>Telescope</i>, to satisfy the <i>restless
          craving</i> I feel to know more of <i>your Planet</i>,
          and of a <i>person of your sex</i> whom I have
          <i>often</i> beheld, and watched with <i>eagerness</i> as
          he came and went. How <i>thrilling</i> the thought, that
          he cannot even <i>know of my existence</i>, and that we
          are <i>forever separated!</i> This, good and <i>dear</i>
          Editor, is my one Thought, my one great Agony.</p>

          Hopeless, as any one may see&#8212;you might at least
          afford me some slight <i>alleviation</i>, by undertaking
          to let Him know of the <i>interest</i> he excites in this
          far-off star! Let me describe my charmer, so that you
          will be able to identify him. He is of fair size, with a
          rolling gait and a smiling countenance, has light hair
          and complexion, wears often a White Hat, (on the back of
          his head&#8212;where Thoughtful men always place the
          hat, I've been told by observers,) and now and then
          carelessly leaves one leg of his trowsers at the top of
          his boot. I have often seen him, with a bundle of papers in
          his pocket, entering a large building with the words
          "<i>Tribune</i> Office" over the door&#8212;and I <i>adore</i>
          him! O excellent Editor! tell him this, I <i>implore</i>
          you! Be kind to your distant and <i>love-lorn</i> friend,
          HELENE."</p>

          <p>F. What did you say, Helene?</p>

          <p>D. I was saying that I wished to look a little longer
          at the fashions in Broadway.</p>

          <p>F. Well, well&#8212;I believe the Fashions are all
          that these women think of! There&#8212;look away! I
          presume they have changed considerably since you looked
          before! When do you wish to begin your lessons in
          Astronomy?</p>

          <p>D. Next week. Father; let me see: we will say, next
          week&#8212;Thursday.</p>

          <p>F. Very well; I shall remind you.</p>

          <p><i><img src="images/05.jpg" align="left" alt="M">EN
          AND ACRES,</i> the new comedy at WALLACK'S, is one of the
          best of TAYLOR'S pieces, and a decided improvement upon
          the carpenter work of BOUCICAULT. It has been
          rechristened by Mr. WALLACK, and its former name&#8212;<i>Old
          Men and New Acres, or New Aches and Old Manors,</i> or
          something else of that sort&#8212;has been
          conveniently shortened. If it does not convince us that
          the author has improved since he first began to write
          plays, it certainly reminds us that there is such a thing
          as <i>Progress</i>. In the latter play, Mr. J.W. WALLACK
          was a civil engineer. In the present drama, he is an
          uncivil tradesman. Both appeal to the levelling
          tendencies of the age; and in each, the author has done
          his "level best"&#8212;as Mr. GRANT WHITE would
          say&#8212;to flatter the Family Circle at the expense
          of the Boxes.</p>

          <p>The cast includes a Vague Baronet and his Managing
          Wife, their Slangy Daughter, their Unpleasant Neighbor
          and his wife and daughter, an Unintelligible Dutchman, an
          Innocuous Youth, a Disagreeable Lawyer, and the Merchant
          Prince. This is the sort of way in which they conduct
          themselves,</p>

          <p><i>Act</i> 1. <i>Disagreeable Lawyer to Vague
          Baronet:</i> "You are ruined, and your estate is
          mortgaged to a Merchant Prince. What do you intend to
          do?"</p>

          <p><i>Vague Baronet.</i> "I will ask my wife what I think
          about it."</p>

          <p><i>Enter Managing Wife.</i> "Ruined, are we? Allow me
          to remark, Fiddlesticks! Get the Merchant to take our
          third-story hall-bedroom for a week, and I'll soon clear
          off the mortgage."</p>

          <p><i>Enter Slangy Daughter.</i> "O ma! there was such a
          precious guy at the ball last night, and I had no end of
          a lark with him. Good gracious! here comes the duffer
          himself."</p>

          <p><i>Enter Merchant Prince. (Aside.)</i> "So here's the
          Vague Baronet and his wife. And there's the slangy girl I
          fell in love with. Nice lot they are!" (<i>To Managing
          Wife.</i>) "Madam, there is nothing, so grand as the
          majesty of trade. Your rank and blood are all gammon. We
          Merchant Princes are the only people fit to live.
          However, I'll condescend to speak to you."</p>

          <p><i>Managing Wife. (Aside.)</i> "How noble! What a
          gentlemanly person he really is!" <i>(To Merchant
          Prince.)</i> "Sir, I bid you welcome. Here is my
          daughter, who was just praising your beauty and
          accomplishments. I leave you to entertain her."
          (<i>Exeunt Baronet, Wife, and Lawyer</i>.)</p>

          <p><i>Merchant Prince (placing his chair next to Slangy
          Daughter's, and leaning his elbow on her.)</i> "There is
          nothing like trade. We tradesmen alone are great. We
          despise the whole lot of clean and idle aristocrats. I
          keep a Gin Palace in Liverpool. Does your bloated
          aristocracy do half as much for suffering humanity?"</p>

          <p><i>Slangy Daughter.</i> "Speak on, speak ever thus, O
          Noble Being! It's awfully jolly!"</p>

          orchestra through the mazes of "Shoo Fly."</i></p>

          <p><i>Appreciative Lady.</i> "Isn't it nice? Miss
          HENRIQUES'S dress is perfectly beautiful, and it sounds
          so cunning to hear her talk slang."</p>

          <p><i>Second Appreciative Lady.</i> "How handsome
          ROCKWELL looks! Just like a real baronet, my dear!"</p>

          <p><i>Other Appreciative Ladies.</i> "The dresses at
          WALLACK'S are always perfectly exquisite. I mean to have
          my next dress made with a green silk fichu, a moire
          antique bertha, and little point lace peplums and
          gussets, just like Miss MESTAYER'S. Won't it be
          sweet?"</p>

          <p><i>All the Counter-Jumpers in the Theatre.</i> "JIM
          WALLACK'S the boy! Don't he talk up to those aristocratic
          snobs, though?"</p>

          <p><i>Enter Merchant Prince and Slangy Daughter. Exeunt
          the other fellows.</i></p>

          <p><i>Merchant Prince.</i> "There is nothing like the
          grandeur of trade; and yet we tradesmen are not proud.
          See! I offer to marry you."</p>

          <p><i>Slangy daughter.</i> "I love you wildly!
          <i>(Aside.)</i> I do hope he won't rumple my hair."</p>

          <p><i>Merchant Prince.</i> "Come to my arrums! The
          majesty of trade is so infinitely above any thing
          else"&#8212;<i>and so forth.</i></p>

          go and tell your father." <i>(They go.)</i></p>

          <p><i>Enter Unpleasant Neighbor.</i> "Here's a telegram
          for you. No bad news, I hope?"</p>

          <p><i>Merchant Prince.</i> "I am ruined unless you lend
          me &#163;40,000. Do it, and I will assign to you the
          mortgage on the baronet's property. The majesty of trade
          is something which"&#8212;</p>

          course you can't have my daughter now."</p>

          <p><i>Merchant Prince.</i> "I resign her. We tradesmen
          are infinitely greater than you aristocrats."</p>

          <p><i>Unprincipled Neighbor.</i> "All right! Now I'll
          foreclose the mortgage, and will be richer than
          ever."</p>

          Neighbor,</i> "The mortgage is due. As you can't pay,
          you've got to move out."</p>

          <p><i>Disagreeable Lawyer.</i> "Not much! Here's an
          analysis of iron ore found on our land. We raised money
          on the mine, and are ready to pay off the mortgage."</p>

          <p><i>Enter Merchant Prince.</i> "Here's an analysis of
          the iron ore. I told them all about it. We tradesmen are
          great, but we will sometimes help even a wretched
          aristocrat."</p>

          <p><i>Slangy Daughter.</i> "Here's an analysis of the
          iron ore. Now I will marry my noble Merchant, and make
          him rich again; for there's dead loads of iron on the
          Governor's land, you bet!"</p>

          if there was a chance; but there isn't. The play is
          really good, and I can't find much fault with the acting.
          However, I'll pitch into STODDARD for swearing, which his
          'Unprincipled Neighbor' does to an unnecessary extent,
          and I'll say that JIM WALLACK is too old and gouty to
          play the 'Merchant Prince,' and doesn't quite forget that
          he used to play in the Bowery."</p>

          <p><i>Every body else.</i> "Did you ever see a play
          better acted? And did you ever see actresses better
          dressed?"</p>

          <p>And PUNCHINELLO is constrained to answer the latter
          question with an emphatic No! As to the acting, it might
          be improved were Mr. STODDARD to play the character for
          which he is cast, instead of insisting upon playing
          nothing but STODDARD. But to all the rest of the actors,
          not forgetting Mr. RINGGOLD, who plays the insignificant
          part of the "Innocuous Youth," PUNCHINELLO is pleased to
          accord his gracious approval.</p>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">HINTS UPON HIGH ART.</p>

          <p>Observant visitors to the National Academy of Design
          will allow that a tendency to greatness is beginning to
          develop itself in certain directions among our artists.
          In landscape some of them are almost immense. The works
          of PORPHYRO warm the walls with rays of splendor, or cool
          the lampooned sight-line with pearly gradations, as the
          case may be. MANDRAKE renders feelingly the summer
          uplands and groves, and SILVERBARK the melancholy
          autumnal woods. BYTHESEA infuses with sentiment even the
          blue wreaths of smoke that curl up from the distant ridge
          against which loom the concentrated lovers that he
          selects for his idyllic romances. Gushingly he does his
          work, but thoroughly; and there are other flowers than
          lackadaisies to be discerned in his herbage. GUSTIBUS
          blows gently the foliage aside, and gives us glimpses
          through it of rural contentment in connection with a
          mill, or some other interesting object beyond. The pencil
          of SAGEGREEN imbues canvases, both large and small, with
          infinite variety and force; and it is to SKETCHMORE that
          the great lakes owe their remarkable reputation as pieces
          of water with poems growing out of their broad lily-pads.
          Very tender are the pastoral banks and brooksides of
          LEAFHOPPER. ELFINLOCKS takes up his pencil, and lo! a
          hazy, mazy, lazy, dreamy vista where it has touched. But
          hold! Our critical Incubus has taken the bit between her
          teeth, and is beginning to run away with us. Stop that;
          and let our readers enumerate the other first American
          landscape painters for themselves.</p>

          <p>Not so strong are our artists in domestic incidents
          and compositions of life and character. We have
          STUNNINGTON, to be sure, whose traits of American
          expression, whether white or colored, are most true to
          the life; and there's BARLEYMOW, who will twist you an
          eclogue from the tail of his foreground pig. Others there
          be; but space has its limits, and we forbear.</p>

          <p>As for our portrait limners, their name is Legion, and
          that comprehensive name must go for all. Like BENVENUTO
          CELLINI they shall be known for their jugs; and their
          transmission to posterity on the heads of families is a
          thing to be reckoned on as sure.</p>

          <p>For the higher flights of art the American painter is
          by no manner of means endowed with the wings of his
          native eagle&#8212;wings that agitate the cerulean
          vault, spattering it with splashes of creamy cloud-spray,
          and churning into butter the stretches of the Milky Way.
          History has indeed been illustrated by American art, but
          has it been enriched? The WASHINGTONS and the WEBSTERS,
          the CLAYS and the LINCOLNS, have had their memories
          dreadfully lampooned on canvas. Allegory does not inspire
          the great American pencil. Tall art there is, and enough
          of it "at that;" but of high art we have none to speak
          of, except the canvases that are placed over doorways in
          the galleries of the Academy, and, in the sense of
          elevation, may consequently be spoken of as high. All
          this is wrong. Alas! that we should write it. Would that
          we could right it! And to think of the musty subjects
          that our historical and allegorical men select. Ho! young
          men&#8212;away with your CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS;
          relegate your METAMORA to his proper limbo; let
          WASHINGTON alone; and LINCOLN; and OSCEOLA the Savage;
          and POCAHONTAS, and all the rest. Leave them alone; and,
          taking fresh subjects, dip your brushes in brains, as old
          OPIE or somebody else said, and go to work with a will.
          No fresh subjects to be had, you say? Bosh! absurd
          interlocutor that you are. Here's a bundle of 'em ready
          cut to hand. We charge you no money for them, and you may
          take your choice.</p>

          <p>AMONG the strange revelations about <i>Tribune</i>
          people elicited during the MCFARLAND trial, was the bit
          of gossip about Mr. GREELEY going to Saratoga to "trip
          the light fantastic toe." That Mr. GREELEY'S toe is
          "fantastic," every body who has ever inspected his
          "Congress gaiters" must know, but as to its lightness we
          have our doubts. "What I know about dancing" would be a
          capital subject for H.G. to handle, and we hope that he
          will take Steps for doing it.</p><br>

          <p><b>JUMBLES</b>.</p>

          <p>Did you ever hear of my friend BOOTSBY? "No." That's
          rather queer. I see&#8212;you've been out of town.
          BOOTSBY is a man of standing&#8212;of decided
          standing, I may say. He stands, in fact, a great deal.
          The heavy standing round he does is enormous when the
          limited capacity of a single mortal is taken in view.
          BOOTSBY stands round among every class of people, and
          especially of politicians and potationers. He stands
          round to talk, to hear, and especially to drink. The
          power of the man in this last matter is wonderful, and
          the puzzle is, that his standing (and perpendicularity)
          is not perceptibly affected. Of course there are times
          when BOOTSBY'S standing is not so good. In so slippery a
          place as Wall Street, it is found to be less certain;
          while in a crowd on Broadway, waiting for a bus, it
          cannot be said to maintain a very remarkable firmness.
          But as a whole, and as the world goes, BOOTSBY is a man
          of standing. In the altitude of six feet ten, he may be
          called a man of high standing. He feels proud of the
          fact. "Is it not better to be a mountain than a mole?" he
          often asks in a proudly sneering manner of his neighbor
          PUGGS, who is about as far up in the world as the top of
          a yard-stick. It is very true that size is not quality,
          and a seven-footer may be no better than a three-footer;
          but it is observed that a Short Man is rarely any thing
          else. His stature is his measure throughout. My own
          impression of myself is, that I don't care to be short;
          but if the alternative were forced upon me, I should
          choose that of person rather than of purse. BOOTSBY does
          not care much about money, and he carries very little.
          Some people are like BOOTSBY, but most people are not.
          The ladies, it is true, never, or rarely, want money.
          Like newspapers and club-houses, they are
          self-supporting. In fact they surround themselves with
          supporters which stay tightly. Mrs. TODD is peculiar in
          her wants pecuniary. She, good soul, never wants (or
          keeps) money long, but she doesn't want it <i>little</i>.
          She prefers it like onions, in a large bunch, and strong.
          The reason why most women do not want money is because
          they have no use for it. They never dress; they never
          wear jewelry; silks and satins have no charms in their
          eyes; laces, ribbons, shawls never tempt. To exist and
          walk upright in simpleness and quiet is the sum of their
          desires. Dear creatures! how is it that they never
          want?</p>

          <p>My neighbor, Mr. DROWSE, desires to know where you get
          all your funny things for PUNCHINELLO? He knows they are
          there, does Mr. DROWSE; for he gets my copy of the penny
          postman, and he keeps it, too. It is the only good taste
          my neighbor has displayed of late years. I tell Mr.
          DROWSE that you make your fun. He further asks, Where? I
          tell him in the attic&#8212;up there where they keep
          the salt. He desires to know the size of attic. Of course
          he has never seen your noble, capacious, alabaster
          forehead, else he would perceive the source of those
          scintillations of light and warmth which radiate
          throughout the universe every Saturday for only ten
          cents. He is curious also to know about the salt, and
          doesn't comprehend how or where you use it. He used to
          use it when a boy in catching birds by putting the briny
          compound on the tails of the same, and <i>that</i> he
          used to call "fun alive;" but he don't see
          it&#8212;the salt&#8212;about PUNCHINELLO. I
          suspect Mr. DROWSE doesn't see the sellers, (certainly he
          avoids them when PUNCHINELLO is offered, much to my
          mortification, and one dime to my cost,) and so is not
          likely to discern the source of the fun. I merely
          informed Mr. DROWSE that the editor was very tall, very
          handsome, with very black skin and rosy hair, (at which
          he opened his eyes with astonishment, and asked if I
          meant so; at which I said, "Yes, I guess so,") and that
          he laughed out of his nose, eyes, head, and hands, as
          well as his mouth. DROWSE wants to see the editor very
          much. He has seen men with black skins and hearts, (for
          he used to know lots of politicians;) but wants to put
          his vision on some "rosy hair"&#8212;and when he
          does, no doubt his gaze will be fixed. It is healthy
          sometimes to have the gaze fixed; and often, like
          sauce-pans and sermons, it has to be fixed. When Mr.
          DROWSE calls at 83, please show him in Parlor 6 with the
          Brussels, fresco-work, and lace curtains.</p>

          <p>April is a model month. So serene, steady, clear, and
          balmy. Nothing but blue sky, gentle zephyrs, kissing
          breezes, genial suns by day and sparkling stars by night.
          PUNCHINELLO no doubt likes sparkling
          stars&#8212;stars of magnitude&#8212;stars that
          show what they are. PUNCHINELLO perhaps goes to NIBLO'S,
          and not only sees plenty stars, but plenty of them. But
          of April. It is called "fickle;" but that's a slander.
          "Every thing by turns and nothing long"&#8212;that is
          a libel on which a suit could be hung. The same vile
          falsehood is cruelly uttered of some women, when every
          body knows, or should know, that these same women are
          nothing of the sort. Who ever knew a fickle woman?</p>

          <p>Where in history is there record of such an
          Impossibility? Fickle&#8212;that implies a change of
          mind. What woman ever changed her mind any more than her
          hands? Nonsense, avaunt!&#8212;banished be slander!
          April is <i>not</i> fickle&#8212;woman is <i>not</i>
          fickle. As one is evenly beautiful, divinely serene,
          bewitchingly winning, so is the other sunny, cerulean,
          balmy, paradisiacal. April for ever&#8212;after that
          the rest of the calendar.</p>

          <p>Does PUNCHINELLO believe in the Woman Movement? TODD
          does. He believes woman should move as much as man; and
          he regards her movement in such numbers to the great West
          as full of hope (and husbands) for the sex. Mrs. TODD has
          not as yet been irresistibly seized by the movement; but
          if TIMOTHY knows himself, he longs for the day when the
          seizer may come. Although TODD&#8212;who is the
          writer of this epistle&#8212;says it, who perhaps
          shouldn't, lest the shaft of egotism be hurled
          mercilessly at him, he does unhesitatingly say that to
          aid this movement he would make the greatest of
          sacrifices. He is willing to sacrifice his wife and other
          female relations upon the sacred altar of the movement,
          and contribute liberally to the expense thereof. He is
          quite willing they should vote&#8212;early and often,
          if need be; but he wishes to see the movement go westward
          like the Star of Empire&#8212;westward
          <i>vi&#226;</i> cheerful Chicago. TODD trusts
          PUNCHINELLO will espouse this movement; for if it does,
          it&#8212;the movement, no less than
          PUNCHINELLO&#8212;will go straight onward and upward;
          but not by the route known as the Spout.</p>

          <p>Mucilage is a good thing. It is now extensively used
          in Church, State, and Society. We use it largely at the
          Veneerfront Avenue Church, of which Rev. Dr. ALEXANDER
          PLASTERWELL is pastor. Of course, Mr. PUNCHINELLO, you
          know that distinguished church, and have no doubt often
          listened to the distinguished Dr. PLASTERWELL. He is a
          kind man, has a high forehead, a Roman (Burgundy) nose,
          and a sweet, soft head&#8212;I should say heart. He
          has&#8212;great and good man&#8212;the largest
          faith in mucilage. He often makes it a text, and he
          sticks to it, he does&#8212;does Dr. PLASTERWELL.
          Nothing like mucilage, PUNCHINELLO. It is the hope of the
          human race, and the salvation of woman. It is the
          Philosopher's Stone in solution; the essence and link
          which connects and cements all that is great, good, and
          lovely, in the past, present, and future. At least, such
          is the humble opinion of</p>

          <p><b>HINTS TO CAR CONDUCTORS.</b></p>

          <p>When standing in Printing House Square, your
          destination being Grand Street Perry or Bleecker Street,
          if a stranger asks whether you are going to Harlem, nod,
          as it is considered improper to answer in the negative.
          If he finds out the mistake, you can plead deafness.</p>

          <p>When called upon to stop, never attempt to comply.
          There are several reasons why you should not. In the
          first place, if you did stop, it would show that you have
          no will of your own, and since the passage of the
          Fifteenth Amendment, <i>all</i> men are equal in this
          country.</p>

          <p>You may stop about two blocks from the place named,
          just to please yourself and prove your independence; but
          take particular care to start the car when the passenger
          is half off the steps. If there is a young surgeon in the
          neighborhood, you can enter into an arrangement to break
          arms and legs in this way with impunity, have the maimed
          "carried into the surgery," and share the fees with the
          operator. Occasional cases of manslaughter may take
          place; but don't mind that, as coroners' juries in
          New-York will return verdicts of "death from natural
          causes." Besides this, remember that you have a vote, and
          that both coroners and judges are dependent upon the
          people. When a lame old gentleman hails you, beckon him
          furiously to come on, but be sure, at the same time, to
          urge the driver to greater speed.</p>

          <p>It is no part of your business to have change, so
          never give any, but drive on: people should provide for
          and look after their own business and that is none of
          yours.</p>

          <p>Always drive through the centre of a target company or
          funeral procession, never minding whether you kill one or
          more, and then abuse the captain or the undertaker for
          his stupidity.</p>

          <p>By the adoption of these essential rules, and by
          adding a good deal of incivility, you will soon reach the
          top of the wheel of your profession and in due time have
          a testimonial presented to you by an admiring and
          grateful public.</p><br>

          <p><b>CONDENSED CONGRESS.</b><p>

          <p><b>SENATE.</b></p>

          <p><img src="images/11.jpg" align="left" alt="">MR.
          SUMNER said he was the friend of the oppressed. That, as
          was well known, was his regular business. Unfortunately,
          the Fifteenth Amendment had rendered the colored man
          incapable of being hereafter regarded as an oppressed
          creature. He was sorry, but it could not be helped. He
          was therefore forced to go down the chromatic scale of
          creation and find another class of clients. He found them
          in cattle. HOMER had sung about the ox-eyed Juno, and
          WALTER WHITMAN about bob veal. COWPER had remarked that
          he would not number in his list of friends the man who
          needlessly set foot upon a cow. He mentioned these things
          merely to show that railway companies had no right to
          starve cattle. He proposed an amendment to the
          Constitution, to provide that a dinner of at least three
          courses should be given to cows daily. Mr. DRAKE was
          heartily in favor of the proposition. He had got his feet
          in a web, so to speak, by paddling in the political
          waters of Missouri, and some people had gone so far as to
          call him "quack." He demanded redress.</p>

          <p>Mr. WILSON didn't see the use of all this legislation
          to protect animals. Animals had no votes, although he
          admitted a partial exception, in that every bull, it had
          its ballot. But he had something practical. Here was a
          jolly job, the Pacific Railway grant. There was a good
          deal more in it than they had made out of any other
          GRANT. Mr. THURMAN'S suggestion, that this land ought to
          be occupied by actual settlers, he scorned. "Actual
          settlers" were of a great deal more use to him in
          Massachusetts, where they could vote for him, than in the
          territories, where that boon would not be extended to
          them. It was much better that they should be occupied by
          imaginary settlers, who could pay and not vote. Actual
          "settlings" were the dregs of humanity.</p>

          <p>The Georgia bill came up, as it does every day with
          much more regularity than luncheon. The Senate has
          succeeded in muddling it to that degree of
          unintelligibility that nobody has the slightest notion
          what it provides. It is, therefore, in a condition to
          give rise to infinite debate. After several senators had
          said enough for a foundation for thirty columns each in
          the <i>Globe,</i> they let it go for the present. The
          present was the one promised by Senator WILSON in return
          for the Pacific Railway grab grant.</p>

          <p><b>HOUSE.</b></p>

          <p>The House is given over to the tariff. A very
          indelicate discussion has been had upon corsets. Mr.
          BROOKS was of opinion that the corset would tariff it
          were subjected to any more strain in the way of duties.
          Mr. MARSHALL remarked that the corset avoided a great
          deal of Waist. It was whalebone of his bone, or something
          of that sort. It was one of the main Stays of our social
          system.</p>

          <p>Mr. SCHENCK made another speech. He ripped up the
          foreign corset in a truculent manner. He said that
          American corsets were far superior, only American women
          had not the sense to see it. The effect of taking off the
          duty on corsets would be to take off the corsets.</p>

          <p>Mr. BROOKS called the hooks and ayes on the corsets.
          Mr. SCHENCK opposed the call. He had found a simple tape
          much preferable. He wished a coffer-dam might be put upon
          the roaring BROOKS.</p>

          <p>Somebody at this point brought up a contested election
          case; but Mr. LOGAN objected to its being considered.
          What, he asked, was the use of wasting time? There was
          money in the tariff. There was no money at all in voting
          a Democrat out, and a Republican in. They could do that
          any day in five minutes. His friend Mr. BUTLER had
          recently remarked, one Democrat more or less made no
          difference. But Mr. BUTLER forgot that the larger the
          majority, the larger the divisor for spoils, and
          therefore the smaller the quotient and the "dividend." He
          did not know much about arithmetic. He had never been at
          West Point; but he believed that a million dollars, for
          instance, would go further and fare worse among two
          hundred men than among three. If the House were not
          careful, there would be a glut of Republicans in it, and
          the shares would be pitifully meagre. As for him, he had
          a great mind, (derisive cheers)&#8212;he repeated,
          that he had a great mind to vote for a Democrat next
          time.</p>

          <p>In spite of Mr. LOGAN'S warning, the House voted in a
          couple or so of Republicans, and then resumed the duty on
          wool.</p>

          <p>Mr. Cox thought this wool had been pulled over the
          eyes of the house often enough. It reminded him of an
          expedition, of which Mr. LOGAN had never heard, in search
          of a "Golden Fleece."</p>

          <p>Mr. JENCKES, and Mr. SCHENCK, and Mr. KELLEY called
          him to order in behalf of their constituents, who were in
          the wool business, and said that "wool" in one form or
          another had always been the staple of their political
          career.</p>

          <p>Mr. BUTLER said he had a little game worth two of
          that. He wanted to buy San Domingo. In this there were
          plenty of commissions, and hundreds of thousands of
          colored votes.</p><br>

          <p><b>IMPORTANT TO PUBLISHERS.</b></p>

          <p>One of our corps of Philosophers (a trifle visionary,
          perhaps) has been speculating as to certain possible (or,
          perhaps, impossible) results flowing from the practice
          among publishers of ante-dating their monthly issues.
          Thus, supposing that the world should be destroyed by
          fire (and why not? it is bad enough) on the 15th of May,
          1870, and a cover of, say, <i>Putnam's</i> for June,
          carried up by an air-current, should, after floating
          about ever so long in space, finally descend on some
          friendly planet&#8212;we will say, Venus. Here it
          would naturally get picked up by an archaeologist, (who
          would be on the spot looking out for it,) and the
          interesting relic would be promptly and reverently
          deposited among the other Vestiges of Creation, in the
          Royal Cabinet. In the course of years, some historian
          would probably have occasion to turn over these
          curiosities, and would presently light on the scorched
          but still legible waif. "Why," says he, in astonishment,
          "I thought the earth was burnt on the 15th of May! To be
          sure, it was <i>in the night</i>, and nobody saw it go,
          [think of that, conceited Worldling!] but it was missed
          by somebody the day after. But here we have a document
          from the late unfortunate planet dated the first of
          June!"</p>

          <p>Of course, upon this the History of the Universe would
          have to be rewritten, or that odd fortnight would play
          the mischief somewhere!</p><br>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">SPIRITUAL SUSCEPTIBILITY OF
          CATS.</p>

          <p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO: Our Society has been very learnedly
          debating as to whether Cats are susceptible of spiritual
          impressions; and, although the burden of opinion inclines
          to the negative of the question, I am firmly persuaded
          there is much to justify a contrary judgment.</p>

          <p>As I slept the other night, neither dreaming nor
          holding psychological intercourse of any description with
          outsiders, I was awakened suddenly about the first hour
          of the morning by a noise. I am quite certain it was a
          noise, and have therefore no hesitation in so recording
          it. The new moon hung athwart the western sky, and a few
          fleecy clouds were chasing each other like snow-drifts
          across the blue vault of the night. I may likewise note
          the fact that the stars were doing what they usually do,
          notwithstanding the difference of opinion that sometimes
          exists as to what that is. It was the evening after
          "wash-day," and family linen, in graceful curves and
          undulating outlines, everywhere met the eye as it turned
          from contemplating the stars to contemplating the
          clothes-lines in the gardens. But I wander. The noise?
          Ah! yes. Well, it was not like the collision of two hard
          substances, but rather of the heavy "thud" order of
          sound, like the descent of a solid into a soft substance;
          say, for instance, of a flat-iron into a jar of unrisen
          buck-wheat batter. I glanced along the ghostly battalions
          of family linen; along the fences traversed by feline
          sentries; along the latticed arbors; but nothing to
          indicate the origin of the alarm could be discovered, and
          as at that moment a breeze stirred in the apartment,
          producing a chilling sensation, I thought it prudent to
          jump back into bed.</p>

          <p>Next morning, upon making my usual visit to note the
          progress of the early bulbs in the flower-beds, I
          encountered at the further end of the garden the remains
          of a cat&#8212;a portly and ancient grimalkin of the
          sterner sex. Close at hand was a bottle lying face
          downward, and corked. I raised it&#8212;first in my
          hands, and then to my lips. The cork fell out,
          accidentally as it were, and, as a consequence, death.
          "Poor thing!" I murmured; "poor&#8212;" and a portion
          of the contents glided carelessly down my throat. I
          perceived that the liquid was "Old Rye." As I stooped
          down, tears would have come to my eyes; but it was
          useless, seeing that the breath had left the
          unfortunate's body. Nevertheless, I rested my hand a
          moment upon his head, and then glided it in a
          semi-professional manner along the line of dorsal
          elevation, until I came to a deep depression in his
          backbone, which corresponded exactly with the convexity
          of the bottle. Then I saw at once how it was; this
          missile, (in the heat of passion, being mistaken for an
          empty one, probably,) had been hurled by some treacherous
          hand upon the unsuspecting Tom, striking him midway
          between the root of the tail and the base of the brain,
          causing instant suspension of his vertebral
          communications, "Poor thing! You were the victim of a
          Catastrophe. You were also the victim of the bottle. The
          'Rye' was too heavy for you, and should have been drawn
          milder." This said, I turned sadly away to find a burial
          spade, and it then occurred to me that this little
          incident was kindly meant to confirm my view that cats
          are susceptible, even to a fatal extent, of spiritual
          impressions&#8212;especially when conveyed by spirits
          of "Old Rye."</p>

          <p><b>A BIT OF NATURAL HISTORY.</b></p>

          <p>Naturalists tell us that the <i>Aye-aye</i> is a small
          animal of Madagascar, with sharp teeth, long claws, and a
          tail; which eats whatever it can grab, and says nothing
          day or night but <i>aye-aye</i>. Now, we find that,
          AGASSIZ to the contrary notwithstanding, this strange and
          not very useful animal is indigenous to the State of
          Pennsylvania. It especially frequents Harrisburg; and may
          be seen and heard any day there, in the Senate or House.
          Being an active member of that House, your correspondent
          has been present during the passage of three hundred
          bills within a week or two, in about one hundred and ten
          of which he had some personal interest.</p>

          <p>Lifting his eyes one day from his newspaper, when the
          Speaker took the vote on an "Act to amend the
          Incorporation of the City of Philadelphia," which your
          correspondent happened to know included the presentation
          of a three-story brownstone front to each of a committee
          of six members of the House, he found there was not one
          member in his seat; but, in the place of a few, there was
          a company of these remarkable <i>Aye-ayes</i>, responding
          duly to the call for a vote; but never a <i>no</i> among
          them. No, no!</p>

          <p>Now, your correspondent holds the deliberate opinion
          that, in several respects, these aforesaid small animals
          of Madagascar might be an improvement upon the average
          Pennsylvania legislators. And, if your correspondent had
          to do with getting up the other one hundred and ninety
          bills, as he did the one hundred and ten, all right:
          Otherwise, <i>not</i>. How does PUNCHINELLO regard

          <p><img src="images/14.jpg" align="left" alt=
          "P">UNCHINELLO has for some time past carefully
          considered the subject of our national tariff of imposts,
          (<i>that is to say, he happened to see, in a Tribune, the
          other day, that lucifer matches were now to be stamped
          separately, and not by the box, as heretofore</i>) and he
          has come to the conclusion, after duly weighing in his
          mind all the arguments for and against the present system
          of taxation, (<i>that is to say, he made up his mind the
          minute he read the article</i>,) that what the present
          tariff needs, is a more thorough application and a better
          classification; or, what the technologists call Taxonomy,
          which term is suggested to him by a work on the subject
          which he has been recently studying. (<i>That is to say,
          he looked in the dictionary to find out what Taxidermy
          meant, and seeing Taxonomy there, snapped it up for a
          sort of collateral pun</i>.) As an illustration of what
          our impost legislators (or imposters) ought to be, let us
          take the Taxidermist. He is one who takes from an animal
          every thing but his skin and bones, and stuffs him up
          afterward with all sorts of nonsense. Now, our National
          Taxidermists ought to take a lesson from their original.
          Many of the good people of the United States have much
          more left them than their skin and bones. Why is not all
          that taken? The condition of the ordinary stuffed animal
          of the shops is strikingly significant of what should be
          expected of loyal communities. (<i>That is to say,
          communities which vote a certain ticket which need not be
          named here</i>.) It is often said that there are things
          which flesh and blood will not bear. Now, a thorough
          system of Taxidermy remedies all this. A stuffed 'possum,
          for instance, having no flesh or blood, will bear any
          thing. When the people of this country are thoroughly
          cleaned out, they will be just as docile. Among the
          things which PUNCHINELLO would recommend as fit subjects
          of taxation, is a man's expenses. They have not been
          taxed yet. If he pays for his income, why not for his
          outgoes? The immense sums that are annually expended in
          this country for this, that, and the other thing ought
          certainly to yield a revenue to the government. (<i>That
          is to say, there ought to be a new army of collectors and
          assessors appointed. P. knows lots of good men out of
          office</i>.) And then there's a man's time. Why not tax
          that? Nearly every man spends a lot of time, and he ought
          to pay for it. As it would be our tax, it could not be a
          very minute tax, although it is only the second tax which
          we have suggested. (<i>That is to say&#8212;something
          pun-ny</i>.) And besides these things, there's energy. We
          often hear of a man's energies being taxed; but, so far
          as the matter is apparent to the naked eye, it is
          difficult to see whose energies are taxed for the good of
          the government at the present day. This subject should
          certainly be investigated. (<i>That is to say, a
          committee of Congressmen should be appointed, with power
          to send for persons, papers, and extra compensation</i>.)
          Politics, too. Every man has his politics, (<i>that is to
          say, every man except Bennett</i>,) and they ought to be
          taxed, if for no other reason than the great impetus the
          measure would give to the erection of fences throughout
          the land. And letters, too. If every one sent by the mail
          should yield one cent to the Treasury, how the currency
          would be inflated in that locality! (<i>That is to say,
          in the locality to which the collectors would
          abscond</i>.) But it is impossible, with the limited time
          at his disposal, for PUNCHINELLO to enter into a full
          examination and elucidation of this subject. (<i>That is
          to say, he can't think of any more illustrations just
          now, and the printer wouldn't stand any more, if he
          could</i>.) But it must be admitted that the great task
          of opening up the country, of which we hear so much, will
          never be complete until the Washington skinners and
          stuffers get us all into the prepared specimen condition.

          to</i> "<i>dry up</i>.")</p><br>

          Se&#241;or CASTELAR, as well as to General PRIM,
          informing them that, on the whole, she thinks she will
          <i>not</i> return to the throne of Spain. It does not
          agree with her quiet and refined tastes and habits to
          live so much in public. All she wants now is a little
          <i>ch&#226;teau en Espagne</i>. She proposes to send
          her son, Prince of ASTURIAS, to Professor CASTELAR, to
          study modern history. Is it not odd, by the way, that a
          country so long <i>Mad-rid-den</i> as Spain, should have
          now a governor with such a name as PRIM? But, what's in a
          name? BOURBON, by any other name, would smell as sweet.
          Some, however, prefer Old Rye. I prefer <i>water</i> to
          both; <i>especially</i> to BOURBON.</p>

          <p>It's an old story that <i>two positives make a
          negative</i>. Paris news tells us that a late will case
          has exemplified this. COMTE, you know, was a
          <i>positive</i> philosopher. He had a positive wife. She
          had a will of her own. He wrote a will of his own.
          Consequently, it got into court. Mme. COMTE it seems, who
          did not agree with the philosophy while the philosopher
          lived, wanted his MSS. after his death. Positively, the
          court did not see it in that light; and so the negative
          came out. It was a case of no go, or <i>non-ego</i>, as
          HEGEL might have called it. Did you ever read HEGEL? I
          didn't; and I advise you not to begin. It won't pay. I am
          told that he divided all things into Egos, She goes, and
          Non-egos, or No-goes. The latter particularly; So do
          I.</p>

          <p>But to return to Spain; or rather to Paris. Don
          FRAN&#199;OIS D'ASSISSI has, it appears, suddenly
          discovered that his wife is not Queen of Spain so much as
          she was. Much less so. So, he has found her company
          rather expensive than agreeable; and proposes to abdicate
          it. Not so <i>very</i> much of an ass, is he? Bravo for
          Don FRAN&#199;OIS!</p>

          <p>In London, <i>to-morrow</i> will be made famous in
          literature by <i>the</i> great dinner in honor of the
          advent of PUNCHINELLO. Mr. PUNCH is talked of to preside.
          An unprecedented rush for tickets has begun. More about
          it in my next.</p>

          <p><b>Cutting.</b></p>

          <p>We see extensively advertised the "Saxon Razor;" but
          have not yet summoned up sufficient courage to try this
          article, which "no gentleman's dressing-case should be
          without." We cannot dispossess our minds of the
          apprehension of cutting ourselves, remembering that line
          descriptive of the combat between FITZ-JAMES and RODERICK
          DHU, in which it is said, that,</p><span style=

          <p>No man can now be a juror who knows any thing about
          the case which he is to try. Thus a juryman was
          challenged in the MCFARLAND case merely because he
          belonged to Dr. BELLOWS's church. It was held that he
          might possibly have got Wind of the matter while
          listening to the Doctor's discourse.</p><br>

          <p><b>BOOK NOTICES.</b></p>

          <p>AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL. By LOUISA M. ALCOTT. Boston:
          ROBERTS BROTHERS. New-York: D. APPLETON &amp; Co.</p>

          <p>The author of "Little Women" seeks, and not without
          success, to draw from her "Old-Fashioned Girl" a contrast
          and a moral. She presents to our view two young ladies of
          opposite "styles." One is fresh and rural: the other
          isn't. The difference between country and city
          bringing-up is the point aimed at; and the difference is
          about as great as that between the warbling of woodside
          birds and the jingle of one of OFFENBACH'S tunes on a
          corner barrel-organ. The book is neatly set forth, with
          illustrations by Messrs. ROBERTS, BROTHERS, of
          Boston.</p>

          <p>RED AS A ROSE IS SHE. By the author of "Cometh up as a
          Flower," etc. New-York: D. APPLETON &amp; Co.</p>

          <p>A readable book, notwithstanding that there are
          several naughty characters in it, or perhaps
          <i>because</i> there are. Probably it depicts with truth
          the kind of society presented. If so, all the worse for
          society. Shall we never again have healthful, virtuous
          novels of the old school, such as "Tom Jones?" The book
          is published in tasteful form by Messrs. D. APPLETON
          &amp; Co.</p><br>

          <p>"The results which crowned the labor of the first week
          were so astonishing that he fears to detail them fully,
          lest doubts should be raised as to his credibility. But
          this much he does not hesitate to claim, that, after a

***** This file should be named 10018-h.htm or 10018-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Cornell University, Joshua Hutchinson, Steve Schulze and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
