          <p><b>THE MYSTERY OF MR. E. DROOD</b>.</p>

          <p>AN ADAPTATION.</p>

          <p>BY ORPHEUS C. KERR.</p>

          <p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>

          <p>INSURANCE AND ASSURANCE.</p>

          <p>Six months had come and gone and done it; the weather
          was as inordinately hot as it had before been intolerably
          cold; and the Reverend OCTAVIUS SIMPSON stood waiting, in
          the gorgeous Office of the Boreal Life Insurance Company,
          New York, for the appearance of Mr. MELANCTHON
          SCHENCK.</p>

          <p>Having been directed by a superb young clerk, who
          parted his hair in the middle, to &quot;just stand out of
          the passage-way and amuse yourself with one of our
          Schedules for awhile,&quot; until the great life-Agent
          should come in, the Gospeler read a few schedulistic
          pages, proving, that if a person had his life Insured at
          the age of Thirty, and paid his premiums regularly until
          he was Eighty-five, the cost to him and profit to the
          Company would, probably, be much more than the amount he
          had insured for. It must, then, be evident to him, that,
          upon his death, at Ninety, the Company would have
          received, in all, sufficient funds from him to pay the
          full amount of his Policy to the lady whom he had always
          introduced as his wife, and still retain enough to
          declare a handsome Dividend for itself. Such was the
          sound business-principle upon which the Boreal was
          conducted; and the merest child must perceive, that only
          the extremely unlikely coincidence of at least four
          insurers all dying before Eighty-five could endanger the
          solvency of the beneficent institution.&#8212;Having
          mastered this convincing argument, and become greatly
          confused by its plausibility, Mr. SIMPSON next gave some
          attention to what was going on around him in the Office,
          and allowed his overwrought mind to relax cheerfully in
          contemplation thereof. One of human nature&#39;s
          peculiarities was quite amusingly exemplified in the
          different treatment accorded to callers who were
          &quot;safe risks,&quot; and to those who were not. Thus,
          the whisper of &quot;Here comes old Tubercles,
          again!&quot; was prevalent amongst the clerks upon the
          entrance of a very thin, narrow-chested old gentleman,
          whom they informed, with considerable humor, that he was
          only wasting hours which should be spent with a spiritual
          adviser, in his useless attempts to take out a Policy in
          <i>that</i> office. The Boreal couldn&#39;t insure men
          who ought to be upon their dying beds instead of coughing
          around Insurance offices. Ha, ha, ha! Another gentleman,
          florid of countenance and absolutely without neck, was
          quickly checked in the act of giving his name at one of
          the desks; one clerk desiring another clerk to look,
          under the head of &quot;A.,&quot; in his book, for
          &quot;<i>Apoplexy</i>,&quot; and let this man see that we
          can&#39;t take such a risk as he is on any terms. A third
          caller, who really looked quite healthy except around the
          eyes, was also assured that he need not call
          again&#8212;&quot;Because, you see,&quot; explained the
          clerkly wag, &quot;it&#39;s no go for you to try to play
          your BRIGHT&#39;S Disease on <i>us!</i>&quot; When,
          however, the applicant was a robustious, long-necked,
          fresh individual, he was almost lifted from his feet in
          the rush of obliging young Boreals to show him into the
          room of the Medical Examiner; and when, now and then, an
          agent, or an insurance-broker, came dragging in, by the
          collar, some Safe Risk, just captured, there was an
          actual contest to see who should be most polite to the
          panting but healthy stranger, and obtain his private
          biography for the consideration of the Company.</p>

          <p>The Reverend OCTAVIUS studied these sprightly little
          scenes with unspeakable interest until the arrival of Mr.
          SCHENCK, and then followed that popular benefactor into
          his private office with the air of a man who had gained a
          heightened admiration for his species.</p>

          <p>&quot;So you have come to your senses at last!&quot;
          said Mr. SCHENCK, hastily drawing his visitor toward a
          window in the side-room to which they had retired.
          &quot;Let me look at your tongue, sir.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked the Gospeler,
          endeavoring to draw back.</p>

          <p>&quot;I mean what I say.
          Let&#8212;me&#8212;see&#8212;your&#8212;tongue.&#8212;Or,
          stop!&quot; said Mr. SCHENCK, seized with a new thought,
          &quot;I may as well examine your general organization
          first.&quot; And, flying at the astounded Ritualistic
          clergyman, he had sounded his lungs, caused a sharp pain
          in his liver, and felt his pulse, before the latter could
          phrase an intelligent protest.</p>

          <p>&quot;You may die at any moment, and probably
          will,&quot; concluded Mr. SCHENCK, thoughtfully;
          &quot;but still, on the score of friendship, we&#39;ll
          give you a Policy for a reasonable amount, and take the
          chance of being able to compromise with your mother on a
          certain per centage after the funeral.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I don&#39;t want any of your plagued
          policies!&quot; exclaimed the irritated Gospeler, pushing
          away the hand striving to feel his pulse again.</p>

          <p>&quot;As you have expressed a desire to resign the
          guardianship of your wards, Mr. and Miss PENDRAGON, and I
          have agreed to accept it, my purpose in calling here is
          to obtain such statement of your account with those young
          people as you may be disposed to render.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; returned the other, in sullen
          disappointment. &quot;That is all, eh? Allow me to inform
          you, then, that I have cancelled the Boreal policies
          which have been granted to the Murderer and his sister;
          and allow me also to remark, that a dying clergyman like
          yourself might employ his last moments better than
          encouraging a Southern destroyer of human life.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I do not, cannot believe that MONTGOMERY
          PENDRAGON is guilty,&quot; said Mr. SIMPSON, firmly.
          &quot;Having his full confidence, and thoroughly knowing
          his nature, I am sure of his innocence, let appearances
          be what they may. Consequently, it is my determination to
          befriend him.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;And you will not have your life
          insured?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I will not, sir. Please stop bothering
          me.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;And you call yourself a clergyman!&quot; cried
          Mr. SCHENCK, with intense scorn. &quot;You pretend to be
          a Ritualistic spiritual guide; you champion people who
          slay the innocent and steal devout men&#39;s umbrellas;
          and yet you do not scruple to leave your own high-church
          Mother entirely without provision at your death.&#8212;In
          such a case,&quot; continued the speaker, rising, while
          his manner grew ferocious with
          determination&#8212;&quot;in such a case, all other
          arguments having failed, my duty is plain. Yon shall not
          leave this room, sir, until you have promised to take out
          a Boreal Policy.&quot;</p>

          <p>He started, as he spoke, for the door of the
          private-office, intending to lock it and remove the key;
          but the unhappy Ritualist, fathoming his design, was
          there before him, and tore open the door for his own
          speedy egress.</p>

          <p>&quot;Mr. SCHENCK,&quot; observed the Gospeler,
          turning and pausing in the doorway, &quot;you allow your
          business-energy to violate all the most delicate
          amenities of private life, and will yet drive some
          maddened mortal to such resentful use of pistol, knife,
          or poker, as your mourning family shall sincerely
          deplore. The articles on Free Trade and Protection in the
          daily papers have hitherto been regarded as the climax of
          all that utterly wearies the long-suffering human soul;
          but I tell you, as a candid friend, that they are but
          little more depressing and jading to the vital powers
          than your unceasing mention of life-insurance.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;These are strong words, sir,&quot; answered Mr.
          SCHENCK, incredulously. &quot;The editorial articles to
          which you refer are considered the very drought of
          journalism; those by Mr. GREELEY, especially, being so
          dry that they are positively dangerous reading without a
          tumbler of water.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Yon brought the comparison upon yourself, Mr.
          SCHENCK. Good day.&quot;</p>

          <p>Thus speaking, the Reverend OCTAVIUS SIMPSON hurried
          nervously from the Boreal temple; not fairly satisfied
          that he had escaped a Policy until he found himself
          safely emerged on Broadway and turning a corner toward
          Nassau Street. Beaching the latter bye-way, after a brief
          interval of sharp walking, he entered a building nearly
          opposite that in which was the office of Mr. DIBBLE; and,
          having ascended numerous flights of twilight stairs to
          the lofty floor immediately over the saddened rooms
          occupied by a great American Comic Paper, came into a
          spidery garret where lurked MONTGOMERY PENDRAGON,</p>

          <p>&quot;Hard at it?&quot; he asked, approaching a
          ricketty table at which sat the persecuted Southerner,
          reading a volume of HOYLE&#39;S Games.</p>

          <p>&quot;My only friend!&quot; ejaculated the lonely
          reader, hurriedly covering the book with an arm. &quot;I
          am, as you see, studying law here, all alone with these
          silent friends.&quot;</p>

          <p>He waved his thin hand toward a rude shelf on which
          were several well-worn City Directories of remote dates,
          volumes of Patent Office Reports for the years &#39;57
          and &#39;59, a copy of Mr. GREELEY&#39;S Essays on
          Political Economy, an edition of the Corporation Manual,
          the Coast Survey for 1850, and other inflaming
          statistical works, which had been sent to him in his
          exile by thoughtful friends who had no place to keep
          them.</p>

          <p>&quot;Cheer up, brother!&quot; exhorted the good
          Gospeler, &quot;I&#39;ll send you some nice theological
          volumes to add to your library, which will then be
          complete. Be not despondent. All will come right
          yet.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;I reckon it will, in time,&quot; returned the
          youth, moodily. &quot;I suppose you know that my sister
          is determined to come here and stay with me?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Yes, MONTGOMERY, I have heard of her noble
          resolution. May her conversation prove sustaining to
          you.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;There will be enough of it, I reckon, to sustain
          half a dozen people,&quot; was the despondent answer.
          &quot;This is a gloomy place for her, Mr. SIMPSON,
          situated, as it is, immediately over the offices of a
          Comic Paper.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;And do you think she would care for cheerful
          accessories while you are in sorrow?&quot; asked the
          Gospeler, reproachfully.</p>

          <p>&quot;But it is so mournful&#8212;that floor
          below,&quot; persisted the brother, doubtfully. &quot;If
          there were only something the least bit more lively down
          there&#8212;say an Undertaker&#39;s.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;A Sister&#39;s Love can lessen the most crushing
          gloom, MONTGOMERY.&quot;</p>

          <p>A silent pressure of the hand rewarded this
          encouraging reminder of sanguine friendship; and, after
          the depressed law-student had promised the Reverend
          OCTAVIUS to walk with him as far as the ferry in a few
          moments, the said Reverend departed for a hasty call upon
          the old lawyer across the street.</p>

          <p>Benignant Mr. DIBBLE sat near a front window of his
          office, and received the visitor with legal serenity.</p>

          <p>&quot;And how does our young friend enjoy himself, Mr.
          SIMPSON, in the retreat which I had the honor of
          commending to you for him?&quot;</p>

          <p>The visitor replied, that his young friend&#39;s
          retreat, by its very loftiness, was calculated to inspire
          any occupant with a room-attic affection.</p>

          <p>&quot;And how, and when, and where did you leave Mr.
          BUMSTEAD?&quot; inquired Mr. DIBBLE.</p>

          <p>&quot;As well as could be expected; this morning, at
          Bumsteadville,&quot; said the Gospeler, with answer as
          terse and comprehensive as the question.</p>

          <p>&quot;&#8212;Because,&quot; added the lawyer, quickly,
          &quot;there he is, now, coming out of a refreshment
          saloon immediately under the building in which our young
          friend takes refuge.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;So he is!&quot; exclaimed the surprised Mr.
          SIMPSON, staring through the window.</p>

          <p>There, indeed, as indicated, was the Ritualistic
          organist; apparently eating cloves from the palm of his
          right hand as he emerged from the place of refreshment,
          and wearing a linen coat so long and a straw hat of such
          vast brim that his sex was not obvious at first glance.
          While the two beholders gazed, in unspeakable
          fascination, Mr. BUMSTEAD suddenly made a wild dart at a
          passing elderly man with a dark sun-umbrella,
          ecstatically tore the latter from his grasp, and
          passionately tapped him on the head with it. Then, before
          the astounded elderly man could recover from his
          amazement, or regain the gold spectacles which had been
          knocked from his nose, the umbrella, after an instant of
          keen examination, was restored to him with a humble,
          almost abjectly apologetic, air, and Mr. BUMSTEAD hurried
          back, evidently crushed, into the refreshment saloon.</p>

          <p>&quot;His brain must be turned by the loss of his
          relative,&quot; murmured the Gospeler, pitifully.</p>

          <p>&quot;His umbrellative, you mean,&quot; said Mr.
          DIBBLE.</p>

          <p>When these two gentlemen had parted, and the Reverend
          OCTAVIUS SIMPSON had been escorted to the ferry, as
          promised, by MONTGOMERY PENDRAGON, the latter, after a
          long, insane walk about the city, with the thermometer at
          98 degrees, returned to his attic in time to surprise a
          stranger climbing in through one of the back windows.</p>

          <p>&quot;Who are you?&quot; exclaimed the Southern youth,
          much struck by the funereal aspect, sexton-like dress,
          and inordinately long countenance of the pallid,
          light-haired intruder.</p>

          <p>&quot;Pardon! pardon!&quot; answered he at the window,
          with much solemnity. &quot;I am a proprietor of the Comic
          Paper down below, and am eluding the man who comes every
          day to tell me how such a paper <i>should</i> be
          conducted. He is now talking to the young man writing the
          mail-wrappers, who, being of iron constitution and
          unmarried, can bear more than I. There was just time for
          me to glide out of the window at sound of that fearful
          voice, and I climbed the iron shutter and found myself at
          your casement.&#8212;Hark! Do you hear the buzz down
          there? He&#39;s now telling the young man writing the
          mail-wrappers what kind of Cartoons should be got-up for
          <i>this</i> country.&#8212;Hark, again! and the young man
          writing the mail-wrappers have clinched and are rolling
          about the floor.&#8212;Hark, once more! The young man
          writing the mail-wrappers has put him out.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Won&#39;t you come in?&quot; asked MONTGOMERY,
          sincerely sorry for the agitated being.</p>

          <p>&quot;Alas, no!&quot; responded the fugitive, in the
          tone of a cathedral bell.</p>

          <p>&quot;I must go back to my lower deep once more. My
          name is JEREMY BENTHAM; I am very unhappy in my mind;
          and, with your permission, will often escape this way
          from him who is the bane of my existence.&quot;</p>

          <p>Being assured of welcome on all occasions, he of the
          long countenance went clanging down the iron shutter
          again; and the lonely law-student, burying his face in
          his hands, prayed Providence to forgive him for having
          esteemed his own lot so hopelessly gloomy when there were
          Comic Paper men on the very next floor.</p>

          <p>That night, before going home to Gowanus, the old
          lawyer across the way glanced up toward MONTGOMERY&#39;S
          retreat, and shook his head as though he couldn&#39;t
          make something out. Whether he had a difficult idea in
          his brain, or only a fly on his nose, was for the
          observer to discover for himself.</p>

          <hr style="width: 45%;">
          <br>

          <p style="font-weight: bold;">UNIVERSOCKDOLOGY.</p>

          <p>Mr. PUNCHINELLO: It afflicts me, one of your most
          assiduous readers, to notice that you cast not even so
          much as a lack-lustre glance at the brilliant gems that
          STEPHEN PEARL ANDREWS scatters periodically through the
          columns of the <i>Evening Mail</i> and WOODHULL &amp;
          CLAFLIN&#39;S <i>Weekly</i>. Are the times out of joint;
          or is it your Italian nose? Do you fear to quote the
          sublimated utterances of the perspicacious, although
          pleonastic philosopher? Does he lead you in thought, or
          the expression thereof? Then, wherefore? And if not,
          wherever may the just reason be found for your
          indifference?</p>

          <p>The science of Universology, as so delightfully
          unfolded by Mr. ANDREWS, is one that must ere long
          overtop and engulf all others, seeing that it is, of
          itself, the science which embodies and contains all. It
          teaches that the universe exists in time and
          space&#8212;a fact never discovered till now&#8212;or
          that, rather, it exists in space and time, as the two
          negative containers of its <i>statism</i> or existence,
          and of its <i>motism</i> or eventuation, (its chain of
          events.) It shows that statism, or
          world-existence-at-rest, in space, is analogous with the
          cardinal series of numeration; and motism or
          world-existence-in-motion, in time, analogous with the
          ordinal series of numbers; and that, finally, statism and
          cardinism, (as of the four cardinal points in the
          orientation of space,) are analogous with spiritualities
          and the spirit world; and that motism and ordinism
          (succession by steps) are analogous with temporalities,
          (transitory things) and so with the mundane or transitory
          sphere.</p>

          <p>Now this is the whole subject in a nutshell&#8212;a
          subject it behooves you and all other deep thinkers to
          grapple withal. Through your efforts to spread the
          glorious truths thus ingeniously set forth, how much good
          might be done! Think of the unravelling of the
          complications surrounding the Germano-Gallic war; the
          light that might be thrown upon the sources of HORACE
          GREELEY&#39;S agricultural information; the settlement of
          the Coolie question. Then, see what effect a clear and
          candid discussion of the topic would have on the public
          morality, security, and peace! How often it appears that,
          in spite of the normal equanimity observable in
          circumstantial evidence, hereditary disciplinarisms are
          totally devoid of potential abstemiousness. This may be
          owing to the fact that at ebb and neap tides the
          obliquity of vision (duism) remarked by most invalid
          veterans in their occasional <i>adversaria</i>, is
          unconscious of their parental dignity, and by no means to
          be confounded with the referees in astronomical or
          pharmaceutical cases, or with ordinary omphalopsychites.
          Whatever be or not be the result of these investigations
          and calculations, it is consolatory to the student of
          proportional hemispheres to remark that, whichever way
          the sophist may turn, he <i>must</i> invariably rely on
          the softer impeachments of a hireling crowd, with</p>

          <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            <span style="margin-left: 1em;">&quot;Water, water,

            <span style="margin-left: 1em;">And not a drop to
            drink,&quot;</span>
          </div>

          <p>and give up all personal interest in the homogeneous
          relations arising from too precipitate a ratiocination of
          events, urging, at the same time, the positive
          proportions exercised in the administration of a not over
          particular dormitory, and the replication of
          chameleonizing&#8212;constantly chameleonizing,
          odoriferosities.</p>

          <p><b>SUMMER AT SANDY POINT.</b></p>

          <p><i>Sandy Point, August 18, 1870</i>.</p>

          <p>PRELIMINARY FLOURISHES.</p>

          <p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO:<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href=
          "#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Nature demands a change
          of air. Man needs rest. Invigoration is necessary to
          health. The throbbing brain must shut down on its
          throbbing.</p>

          <p>Hence second-class hotels, with first-class prices;
          hence hard beds, no gas, and many flies. I
          say&#8212;&quot;Hence&#8212;flies,&quot; but as a general
          thing I notice they will not hence.</p>

          <p>WHERE TO GO.</p>

          <p>Those who are fond of flees may flee to the mountains.
          I know when I&#39;ve got enough, and I prefer to surf it
          on the sea shore. Take the 3-1/2 A.M. train, and come
          to</p>

          <p>SANDY POINT.</p>

          <p>Everything here is sand as far as the eye can reach,
          or a horse and wagon, with a profane driver, can travel.
          The ocean laves the beach. The sea also is here. The tide
          comes in twice a day. This alone gives Sandy Point a
          great advantage over all other points on the coast.</p>

          <p>I rode up in the regular conveyance, and soon after my
          arrival found myself standing on the spacious and elegant
          piazza of</p>

          <p>THE CHARNEL HOUSE,</p>

          <p>a palatial structure erected by the late Mr. CHARNEL,
          who is said to have lavished an immense fortune upon it.
          Strictly speaking, he didn&#39;t lavish quite so much
          paint on the front as an advanced civilization had a
          right to expect; but within, everything, (including the
          clerk,) appears to have been furnished with an eye to</p>

          <p>LUXURIOUS COMFORT,</p>

          <p>Mr. SOAPINGTON, the genial landlord, Mr. RICHARD
          SOAPINGTON, Jr., the gentlemanly clerk, Mrs. SOAPINGTON,
          the accomplished hostess, and the lovely Miss CLARA
          SOAPINGTON, all greeted me with that hearty welcome, so
          dear to the traveller. SOAPINGTON said he was glad to see
          me, and, seeing that it was me, he would be willing to
          infringe on his inflexible rule, and would allow me to
          pay</p>

          <p>CASH IN ADVANCE.</p>

          <p>Madame S. was sorry she couldn&#39;t set me up a cot
          in the wash-room, but would be compelled to let me have a
          double front-room over the bar. I told her if the
          apartment had a practicable trap door I thought I could
          get along.</p>

          <p>RICHARD S., Jr., was sure he had met me before; and,
          as a friend, he would say the establishment was not
          responsible for valuables unless deposited in the safe.
          He would take my watch and jewelry to wear while I was
          there, inasmuch as</p>

          <p>HE WAS THE SAFE HIMSELF.</p>

          <p>The charming Miss S. didn&#39;t say anything, but she
          smiled, and looked such unutterable things from behind
          the blinds, that I expect to find it all in the bill.</p>

          <p>Everybody that can get a railroad pass should come to
          Sandy Point</p>

          <p>WHAT TO DO.</p>

          <p>Sit in the reading-room and look over the torn files
          of two daily papers a week and a half old; or study a
          hotel advertiser.</p>

          <p>THE SURF BATHING</p>

          <p>is magnificent. The prevalence of an unmitigated
          undertow renders it quite exhilarating for old ladies and
          invalids. Any one who is drowned will have every
          attention paid to his remains,&#8212;by the sharks.</p>

          <p>BOATING.</p>

          <p>Everybody boats. The ROWE Brothers are here, and sing
          on the water by moonlight. You can blister your bands at
          an oar, or bale out the boat, just as your taste
          inclines. As the life-preserver is a little out of
          repair, I stay on shore.</p>

          <p>FISHING.</p>

          <p>Everybody fishes. There are all varieties, from
          speckled trout and mackerel, up to conger eels, horse
          mackerel, and porpoises. Parties frequently come back
          with all the fishing they want. If absent a week on a
          trip, they can make arrangements to have their board run
          on just the same.</p>

          <p>DRIVING.</p>

          <p>Everybody drives. The roads are of unsurpassing
          loveliness. They drive every day. If the waiters would
          drive a few flies out of the dining-room, we wouldn&#39;t
          sit down quite so many at table.</p>

          <p>WHO ARE HERE.</p>

          <p>Sandy Point, with all its native attractions, would be
          nothing were it not for the beauty and fashion that
          throng its halls. There are men here who can draw their
          note for any amount. Here is an ex-member of Congress;
          there a double X brewer, both immensely wealthy. Diamonds
          abound. There is a hop in the parlor every evening and
          preaching on Sundays.</p>

          <p>I should not forget a paralytic washwoman in my
          section of the house, who has a prevailing idea, when she
          brings home my clothes, that eleven pieces make a
          dozen.</p>

          <p>Reader, if you seek</p>

          <p>THE FLUSH OF HEALTH,</p>

          <p>come down here! I wasn&#39;t very flush when I got
          here, but I don&#39;t intend to go away till I&#39;ve put
          myself into thorough repair.</p>

          <p>Yours, SARSFIELD YOUNG.</p>

          <p>Punchinello&#39;s Vacations.</p>

          <p>Sometimes Mr. PUNCHINELLO is very busy. Not only has
          he upon his shoulders the ordinary labors of conductor of
          a great journal, but he has much to do for other people.
          His editors, his printers, his binders, his artists, his
          engravers, his corps of clerks, his office and errand
          boys, and all connected with his extensive establishment,
          come to him from time to time for advice in regard to the
          investment of their surplus earnings, and between
          assisting in the purchase of a farm for this one, a house
          for the other, and all sorts of stocks and bonds for the
          rest, he is often terribly pressed for time.</p><img src=
          "images/06a.jpg" align="left" alt="">

          <p>No one who is not looked up to by a crowd of grateful
          dependents, all fattening in the shadow of his
          prosperity, as it were, can understand Mr. P&#39;s.
          feelings of responsibility at such times.</p>

          <p>Such an unusual demand upon his time occurred last
          week, and Mr. P. found that he would not be able to spend
          a few days as usual at some fashionable watering place.
          But be must have some recreation, so he determined to
          have a day&#39;s fishing among the celebrated Thousand
          Islands of the St. Lawrence. He put some luncheon in a
          basket, and set off quite early in the morning. Finding
          that some twenty hours were consumed in the transit, Mr.
          P. thought that, considering his hurry, he had better,
          perhaps, have gone to Newark for a day&#39;s fishing off
          the piers. But he was at the St. Lawrence now, and it
          would not do to complain. He hired a boat, lines, bait
          and two navigators, and set out bravely.</p><img src=
          "images/06b.jpg" align="right" alt="">

          <p>He sailed among a crowd of islands where either the
          bowsprit or the boom was continually getting caught in
          the shrubbery and rocks, until he came to island No. 18.
          Here was a picnic party.</p>

          <p>For reasons which the accompanying view may render
          obvious, Mr. P. and his men declined the invitation of
          the picnickers to stop and join them. The boat continued
          on until it reached the channel between islands No. 87
          and No. 88, and there Mr. P. got out his lines and
          commenced to fish, trolling his bait behind as the boat
          slowly sailed, under the hot sun, among those lovely
          isles, where, to be sure, burning&#39;s half o&#39; the
          sport, but where &quot;burning SAPPHO&quot; would have
          lost herself utterly, and probably have tumbled into some
          of the watery intricacies and have put herself out.</p>

          <p>Mr. P. did not have much luck at first. He caught one
          muskallonge, after a period of patient waiting which he
          feels he also must call long, and once, when he thought
          he was hauling in a fine bass, he turned very red when
          the boatmen laughed at seeing him &quot;cotch an
          eel.&quot; But after a while he got a royal bite. He
          hauled in manfully, and although, owing to the
          intricacies of the channel, he could not see what he had
          caught, he knew it was a fine fellow from its weight. At
          last, after tremendous tugging, he got it in over the
          stem.</p><img src="images/06c.jpg" align="left" alt="">

          <p>It was one of the thousand islands!</p>

          <p>What could be done now?</p>

          <p>The steersman, who had slipped under a seat when he
          saw the great mass above him, and the man who managed the
          sails, were both Canadians, and after a great deal of
          excited talk, they agreed if Mr. P. would make it worth
          their while, they would endeavor to put the island back
          in its place and make no remarks in public which would
          tend to produce a misunderstanding between the
          governments of Great Britain and the United States, on
          the ground of undue acquisition of territory. By the
          payment of a sum, which it will require a club of thirty
          subscribers to make good to him, Mr. P. concluded the
          arrangement, and they sailed back to replace the island.
          But what was the horror of the party, when they perceived
          on the unfortunate bit of British territory, a plate,
          which had stuck fast by reason of a covering of the juice
          of plum-pie, and a fork which was rammed firmly into the
          earth!</p>

          <p>It needed but few collateral evidences to convince Mr.
          P. and his men that this was the island where they had
          seen the picnic.</p>

          <p>And where were the picnickers?</p>

          <p>If any of Mr. P&#39;s. subscribers in Prince EDWARD
          Island, Costa Rica, the Gallipagoes, or other outstanding
          places, receive their paper rather late this week, they
          are informed that, in consequence of his having spent
          three entire days exploring the labyrinth of these
          islands in order to find the bodies of the unfortunate
          party of pleasure, (which bodies he did not find,) Mr. P.
          was very much delayed in his office business. His near
          patrons received their papers in due time, but those at a
          distance will excuse him, he feels sure, when they
          consider what his feelings must have been, while
          grappling for an entire picnic.</p>

          <p>The island was dumped down anywhere, without reference
          to its former place. When the Alabama claims are settled,
          Mr. P. will go back and adjust it properly.</p>

          <p>Mr. P. gained nothing by this trip but the knowledge
          that there are but 980 of these islands, which an
          unscrupulous monarchy imposes upon a credulous people as
          a full thousand, and the gloom which would naturally
          pervade a man, after an occurrence of the kind just
          narrated.</p>

          <p>On his way home, he stopped for supper at Albany, and
          there he met CYRUS W. FIELD and Commodore VANDERBILT. One
          of these gentlemen was looking very happy and the other
          very doleful.</p>

          <center>
            <img src="images/06d.jpg" alt="">

          <p>(The tall gentleman in the picture is Mr.
          FIELD&#8212;not that he is really so very tall&#8212;but
          he is elevated. The short one is the Commodore&#8212;so
          drawn, not because he is short, but because he is
          depressed.)</p>

          <p>After the compliments of the season, (warm ones,) Mr.
          P. asked his friends how the war in Europe affected
          them.</p>

          <p>&quot;Gloriously!&quot; cried Mr. FIELD. &quot;Nothing
          could be better. The messages fly over our cables
          like&#8212;like&#8212;like lightning. Why, sir, I wish
          they would keep up the war for ten years.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;And you, sir?&quot; said Mr. P. to the
          Commodore.</p>

          <p>&quot;Oh, I hate it!&quot; said VANDERBILT. &quot;They
          send neither men nor munitions by our road. It is an
          absolute dead loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars to
          me that my railroad is on this side of the ocean. I shall
          never cease to deplore it.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;But sir,&quot; said Mr. P. &quot;the war may
          cause a great exportation of grain from the West, and
          then your road will profit.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Don&#39;t believe it,&quot; said the Commodore.
          &quot;The war will stop exportation.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;It goes against the grain with him, any way you
          fix it,&quot; said Mr. FIELD, with a festive air.
          &quot;He can&#39;t carry any messages.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;On a cabalistic cable,&quot; remarked Mr. P.</p>

          <p>CYRUS smiled.</p>

          <p>&quot;No, air,&quot; said the Commodore, reverting to
          his grievances. &quot;Never has such a loss happened to
          me, since I went into New York Centrals.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Well, I tell you, VANDY,&quot; said Mr. FIELD,
          &quot;if you and other grasping creatures had kept away
          from New York&#39;s entrails it would have been much
          better for the body corporate of the State.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Look here!&quot; cried the Commodore, in a
          rage.</p>

          <p>Mr. FIELD looked there, but Mr. P. didn&#39;t. He
          thought it was time to go for his train, and he went.</p>

          <p><img src="images/07a.jpg" align="left" alt="W">hy
          there should be such a thing as a New York Rendering
          Company is a puzzle to thoughtful minds. Persons resident
          in certain districts of the city, that border on the
          North River, though, are cognizant of that Company. The
          North River nose knows the Co., and would close itself to
          it, only that it is too close upon it to close
          effectually.</p>

          <p>And what are the New York Rendering Company, and to
          whom do they render, and what? Lard bless you! sir, or
          madam, they comprise a thing that lives, if not by the
          sweat of its brow, at least by the suet of its boilers.
          The dead horses of the city car companies are the
          creature&#39;s normal food. Nor does it despise smaller
          venison, for it can batten upon dead kittens, too, and
          fatten upon asphyxiated pup. Carnivorous, decidedly, is
          the creature concreted by the New York Rendering Company,
          converting all that it touches into fat, and so, living
          literally upon the fat of the land. That the Company
          render other things besides fat, however, has been for
          some time past a subject of complaint against their
          management, and here are a few details of their
          renderings.</p>

          <p>Once the atmosphere of the bays and rivers of New York
          was a source of health to the excursionists who, in
          summer time, seek relaxation by inexpensive voyages upon
          the waters adjacent to the city. By casting the refuse of
          their carrion into these waters, the New York Rendering
          Company have rendered foul and noxious the once healthful
          atmosphere of our aquarian outlets, rendering themselves
          a nuisance, at the same time.</p>

          <p>Thus, anything like a &quot;pleasure&quot; excursion
          by water, in the neighborhood of New York, has been
          rendered impossible during the present season, by the New
          York Rendering Company.</p>

          <p>Off all the shores of our bays Offal has accumulated,
          and that during the hottest summer on record for these
          latitudes. The waters have thus been rendered unfit for
          bathing in, as the air has been rendered pernicious to
          breathe&#8212;another rendering by the New York Rendering
          Company, whose manifest mission is to offalize the
          world.</p>

          <p>It is pleasant to know, then, that the renderings of
          the New York Rendering Company are likely to be
          reactionary as well as suicidal, (perhaps suetcidal might
          be a better word here,) in their results. Their
          &quot;offence is rank,&quot; and has reached the nose of
          authority, for we find it stated that &quot;Mayor HALL
          has already made complaint against the New York Rendering
          Company, and that they will he indicted at the next
          sitting of the Grand Jury.&quot;</p>

          <p>And when their boiling nuisances come to be seized, as
          we trust they will be, how jolly to see them
          &quot;rendering to Seizer&quot; all that has rendered
          them the nuisance they are! Then let them render up the
          ghost, and go out spluttering, like a dip candle from one
          of their own rancid renderings&#8212;and so an end of
          them.</p>

          <p><b>A CARD OF THANKS.</b></p>

          <p>PUNCHINELLO is extremely indebted to <i>The Sun</i>
          for the association of the names of several worthy
          gentlemen with the ownership of the only first-class
          Illustrated Humorous and Satirical paper published in
          America: (Subscription price, for one year, $4.00. Single
          copies 10 cents. Office, 83 Nassau St., New York.)</p>

          <p>Well, it is something to be credited with having
          decent men about you; perhaps if <i>The Sun</i> would try
          the experiment it would be found more purifying than even
          the sermons of O. DYER.</p>
          <hr style="width: 45%;">
          <br>

          <p><b>WHY IT IS SO DRY.</b></p>

          <p>We <i>thought</i> it had something to do with a lack
          of moisture in the air; and now, along comes Monsieur
          PROU, another philosopher, and merely says what we had
          thought. He declares that there was so much ice last
          winter (come now, gentlemen of the Ice Companies, what
          have you to say to that?) it couldn&#39;t melt in time to
          evaporate in time to supply moisture in time for the
          necessary showers. (Somehow, there&#39;s an eternity of
          &quot;time&quot; in that sentence; but <i>n&#39;importe:
          allons!</i>) We think PROU has proved his case. And,
          although we can&#39;t quite sympathise with his
          suggestion that detachments of sappers and miners be
          employed in the spring-time, in Arctic (and doubtless
          also Antarctic) regions, in blowing up icebergs and
          otherwise facilitating the operations of old Sol, we give
          the ingenious Frenchman credit for at least as much
          philosophic acumen as we ourselves possess: and Heaven
          only knows how superb a compliment we thus convey!</p>

          <p>Couldn&#39;t our friend Capt. HALL be requested to
          watch the Pole a little next winter, and look into this
          idea of ours and PROU&#39;S?</p>

          <p><b>OUR POLICE REPORT.</b></p>

          <p>On Tuesday last a suspicious looking man was arrested
          by the police, and taken to the One Hundred and Fourth
          Precinct Station House, on several charges of disorderly
          acts perpetrated by him in various parts of the city. He
          gave his name as CHARLES A. DANA, and was locked up for
          the night.</p>

          <p>Yesterday morning, prisoner was brought before Justice
          DOWNY, at the Jephson Market Police Court.</p>

          <p>Officer LOCUST, being called to testify, stated that
          his attention was directed to the prisoner, on Tuesday
          afternoon last, by some boys in Fourteenth Street.
          Prisoner was standing on the side-walk, on the side of
          the street opposite Tammany Hall. He was armed with a
          small pewter squirt, with which he was trying to smear
          the front of that building by drawing up dirty water from
          the gutter. The range of the squirt did not appear to
          reach more than half-way across the street. The water
          used was very foul, leaving stains upon a dirt-cart that
          was passing. While witness was watching the prisoner, the
          Hon. WM. M. TWEED came down the steps from Tammany Hall,
          and, upon seeing him, prisoner ran away, but was seized
          by witness, before he could make his escape.</p>

          <p>On being interrogated by the magistrate, prisoner said
          that he hardly knew what he was doing when arrested. The
          <i>Sun</i> was in his eyes at the time. If it hadn&#39;t
          been so, he would not have missed his shot. He must do
          something for a living, and he thought that throwing
          dirty water was as good an occupation as any other. Had
          made money out of it by threatening respectable people
          with his pewter squirt, and they would give him money
          rather than have their clothes soiled. He would do
          anything to make money; and he didn&#39;t in the least
          mind dirtying his hands in the making of it.</p>

          <p>To a question by the magistrate, as to whether he had
          had anything to do with casting offal into the bay,
          prisoner laughed in a wild manner, and said that he, for
          one, could never be accused of wasting good, honest dirt
          in that way. All the offal in the world, said prisoner,
          wasn&#39;t too much for him to use in bespattering the
          objects of his attention, friends as well as foes. He had
          heaved tons of offal, already, at Mr. A. OAKEY HALL,
          (whom he evidently imagined to be an Irishman, and called
          O&#39;HALL,) He didn&#39;t care whom he hit, in fact, so
          long as he could make it pay.</p>

          <p>A gentleman connected with the velocipede interest,
          whose name our reporter did not catch, here stated that
          he became acquainted with prisoner nearly two years ago,
          while the velocipede frenzy was at its height. He had
          constructed to order for the prisoner a peculiar
          velocipede called the <i>&quot;Sun Squirt.&quot;</i> It
          had a Dyer&#39;s tub attached to it, which was filled
          with bilge-water. On this machine, the prisoner, armed
          with a pewter squirt, used to practise for several hours
          a day, careering rapidly around the rink, and taking
          flying shots, as he went, at large posters attached to
          the wall, having portraits on them of General GRANT, Hon.
          H. GREELEY, Hon. WM. M. TWEED, The Mayor, Governor
          HOFFMAN, and several other citizens of admitted position
          and respectability. The bilge-water usually came back
          upon him, however, and he was generally a humiliating
          object on leaving the rink.</p>

          <p>Prisoner, on being asked by the magistrate whether he
          had any references respecting character to give, replied
          in the negative, whereupon orders were issued to lock him
          up, pending the appearance of Mr. PUNCHINELLO, who will
          have some statements to make about him at a future
          day.</p>

          <p>A reward of $5,000 has been offered for any
          information about the pewter squirt, and particularly as
          to when, and by whom it was made; and, as detectives are
          now engaged in working up the case, there can be but
          little doubt that the vile instrument will ere long be
          identified.</p>

          <p><b>DISTRESSING.</b></p>

          <p>Some awful smasher of cherished notions is trying to
          make out that ROUGET DE LISLE was not the real author of
          the famous <i>Marseillaise</i>, but that he stole it from
          the Germans. It pains us to contemplate the possibility
          of the charge being true, but, should it prove to be so,
          we suggest that the name of the accepted author be
          changed from ROUGET to ROGUEY DE LISLE.</p>

          <p><b>HIRAM GREEN AMONG THE FAT MEN.</b></p>

          <p>The &quot;Last Gustive&quot; attends the Annual
          Clam-Bake.</p>

          <p>Empires may totter and Dienastys pass in their
          checks.</p>

          <p>Politicians may steal the Goddess of Liberty poorer
          than JOB&#39;S old Maskaline Gobbler.</p>

          <p>J. FISK, Jr., may set the heel of his bute down onto
          the neck of Rail Rodes&#8212;Steambotes&#8212;ballet
          gals, and all that sort o&#39; thing, and this mundane
          speer will jog along, as slick as a pin, and no questions
          asked.</p>

          <p>But deprive a Fat man of his little clam-bake, and it
          would be full as pleasant as settin&#39; down onto a
          Hornet&#39;s nest, when the Hornet family were all to
          home.</p>

          <p>That&#39;s so.</p>

          <p>Another cargo of clams has gone to that born whence no
          clam returns, onless you ram your finger down your
          throte, or take an Emetick.</p>

          <p>In the words of Commodore PERRY, who is, alas! no
          more.</p>

          <p>&quot;The misfortenit bivalves meet the Fat man, and
          they&#39;re his&#39;n.&quot;</p>

          <p>Altho&#39; I&#39;me not much on the fat order myself,
          I received an invitation to attend the grate Clam-bake.
          Mrs. GREEN put me up a lunch to eat on the cars, and
          robin&#39; myself in a cleen biled shirt, I sholdered my
          umbreller and left Skeensboro.</p>

          <p>The seen at Union Park was sublime with plenty of Ham
          fat. If all flesh is grass, thought I, when old <i>tempus
          fugit</i> comes along with his mowin&#39; masheen to cut
          this crop of fat men, I reckon he will have to hire some
          of his nabor&#39;s barns, to help hold all of his
          hay.</p>

          <p>Great mountins of hooman flesh were bobbin&#39; about
          like kernals of corn on a red hot stove, remindin&#39; me
          of a corn field full of punkins set up on clothes
          pins.</p>

          <p>The little heads on top of the great sweating bodies,
          looked as if they were sleev buttons drove in the top of
          the Punkins.</p>

          <p>When a fat man laffs, his little head sinks down into
          his shirt collar, and disappears in the fat, like a
          turtle&#39;s head when you tickle his nose with a sharp
          stick.</p>

          <p>And then to see them eat clams. I&#39;ve seen men
          punish clams by the bushel&#8212;by the barrel&#8212;but
          never did I see men shovel clams in by the cart load
          before.</p>

          <p>&quot;Gee-whitaker,&quot; said I, to a Reporter of a
          N.Y. Journal, &quot;them critters must have a dredful
          elastic stomack.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;when Fat-men get clam
          hungry, the sea banks has to give up her clams, and the
          grocery keepers furnish the seasonin&#39;.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Wall,&quot; said I, &quot;if the Sea has many
          such runs on her clam-banks as this, she will have to put
          on her shutters soon, and go into lickerdation.&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;In which state,&quot; said he laffin&#39;,
          &quot;it would be exceedin&#39;ly
          <i>clam</i>-etous.&quot;</p>

          <p>The members of the Fat Men&#39;s Club all went
          prepared for hot weather, dressed in a linnen soot and
          carryin&#39; palm leaf fans.</p>

          <p>I also notised large fassits onto the toes of their
          butes, so as to let out the grease occasionly, and keep
          there butes from sloppin&#39; over.</p>

          <p>President RANSOM told me, that a fat man&#39;s wife
          invented the fassets, so as to save sope grease.</p>

          <p>&quot;One fat man in hot weather,&quot; said Mister
          RANSOM, &quot;will furnish grease enuff, in the summer
          time, to keep his family in soft sope the year around,
          besides supplyin&#39; two or three daily papers with a
          lot.&quot;</p>

          <p>Between you and me, Friend PUNCHINELLO, that greasy
          yarn seems rather too slipperry to swaller, but I guess
          it&#39;ll wash after all.</p>

          <p>PETER REED, of New York, and Docter WHITBECK, of West
          Troy, danced the hiland fling for the championship and a
          barrel of clams.</p>

          <p>&quot;While PETE was cuttin&#39; a pigin wing, and the
          Dr. was rakin&#39; down a dubble shuffle, they made
          things rattle, and naborin&#39; towns thought it was an
          airthquake, and began movin&#39; out their feather
          beds.</p>

          <p>&quot;Go it, my fat friends,&quot; said I, to
          encourage &#39;em, &quot;blood will tell, and exercise
          help to digest your clams.&quot;</p>

          <p>They shook their feet ontil exhausted natur, from
          necessity, ceased to be virtous, when suddenly they both
          tumbled over onto their backs, and blowed like
          porpoises.</p>

          <p>The weather bein&#39; hot, a shovel full of cloride of
          lime was sprinkled onter them, to keep them from
          gettin&#39; fly blode.</p>

          <p>I was introjuced to a North River steembote pilot,
          whose corporosity looked like the Commissary department
          of a Prushion Regiment.</p>

          <p>&quot;How are you, Paunchy Pilate,&quot; said I,
          gettin&#39; off a joak at his expense. &quot;How many
          clams have you crucifide to-day?&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;Bully for you, ole man. Haw! haw! he! he! ho!
          ho!&quot; roared half a dozen fat men at my faceshusness,
          and they laffed and shook their sides, ontil I thought
          they&#39;d colaps a floo and spatter me.</p>

          <p>One of them fat men approched me, and invited me to
          have a game of leep frog.</p>

          <p>&quot;Excuse me, Captin,&quot; said I, &quot;when I
          get so I can sholder an elefant, I&#39;le come around and
          accomodate you.&quot;</p>

          <p>Some was playin&#39; tag. Some was playin&#39;
          blindman&#39;s-buff, while all was amusin&#39;
          themselves, at some innocent pastime or other.</p>

          <p>The day&#39;s performance was closed by chasin&#39; a
          greased pig.</p>

          <p>The hog was well greased and let loose, and the whole
          lot of fat men started pell-mell.</p>

          <p>It was &quot;Root hog, or die&quot; with the odds in
          favor of the Hog.</p>

          <p>All of a sudden, the hog turned back, and the fat men
          coulden&#39;t stop, when down they all fell on top of
          poor piggy, smashin&#39; him flatter&#39;n a pancake.</p>

          <p>The bystanders were startin&#39; for derricks and
          jack-screws to raise the fat men off from each other.</p>

          <p>&quot;Hold on,&quot; says I, &quot;I know a trick
          worth 2 of that.&quot;</p>

          <p>I rusht into the house, and ceasin&#39; the
          dinner-bell, rung it as hard as I could.</p>

          <p>It delited me, in my old age, to see them chaps
          scrabble when they heard that bell.</p>

          <p>In 10 seconds time, only one member of the pile
          diden&#39;t git up, and rise, and that was the hog.</p>

          <p>It was a cruel deception&#8212;but I believe the mean
          trick justifide the end, and saved the Bord of Helth a
          big bill of expense. For sure&#39;s you&#39;re borned, it
          would have been a meesely old job, cartin&#39; of that
          big pile of corrupshun.</p>

          <p>I had seen enuff for one day.</p>

          <p>My fisikle and intelectooal capacity was gorged.</p>

          <p>Foldin&#39; my Filacteries, and pickin&#39; up my bloo
          cotton parashoot, I fled the seen, hily tickled to think
          I wasen&#39;t a fat man.</p>

          <p><b>OUR FINANCIAL ARTICLE.</b></p>

          <p>WALL STREET, August 9th, 1870.</p>

          <p>SIR:&#8212;It is with feelings of indignation and
          scorn that I proceed once more to pollute my pen with the
          chronicles of a mercenary rabble. It <i>had</i> been
          thought that the remonstrances of the pure and
          high-minded among your readers would have sufficed to
          overcome the resolution of an infatuated, but not
          Criminal Editor. There was a time when the claims of a
          <i>Certain Contributor</i> were wont to be considered.
          But the passion for worldly greed has, alas! perverted a
          too simple nature, and where the Muses once found a
          congenial resting place, the demon Mammon now sits in
          GHASTLY TRIUMPH.</p>

          <p>I will not here refer to my threat of resignation, nor
          to the shouts of diabolical laughter with which it was
          received by the conductor of a Comic Journal, whose name
          it would not become me to mention. Suffice it to say that
          those sentiments of loyalty and affection which have ever
          been my glory, and a keen appreciation of the difficulty
          of obtaining employment on the Press, have kept me
          attached to the staff of PUNCHINELLO. The anguish which
          Finance has cost an artistic soul no one may ever know.
          The silent tear may fall, but it shall be buried in my
          bosom. The spectacle of my hidden suffering shall stand
          as a reproach to one whom I once HONORED and now
          PITY.</p>

          <p>Divesting myself of that part of my nature which is
          comprised in the good, the beautiful and true, I betook
          myself yesterday to Wall Street and the Gold Room. At the
          portals of the Financial Menagerie, a gentleman placed
          his hand upon my shoulder.</p>

          <p>Was I a subscriber?</p>

          <p>No, but I was a comic writer.</p>

          <p>He said I looked as though I had seen misfortune. If I
          was not a subscriber, perhaps I had been in the
          Penitentiary, served out a sentence at Sing Sing, or
          procured a divorce from my wife?</p>

          <p>I had done none of these things.</p>

          <p>I was not a member of the Legislature?</p>

          <p>No.</p>

          <p>A brilliant idea struck him. Perhaps I had been an
          editor?</p>

          <p>I pleaded guilty.</p>

          <p>He thought that would do&#8212;I might go in.</p>

          <p>I went in, and herewith submit to you the result of my
          investigations.</p>

          <p>NINE O&#39;CLOCK.&#8212;On opening this morning, a
          scarcity of money was perceptible in the market. It was
          especially perceptible in the case of your contributor.
          (This is <i>not</i> a hint that a week&#39;s salary in
          advance would be acceptable.) Peanuts are much sought
          after. (They are excellent things to pelt a fellow with.)
          Apples were inquired after, but upon a rumor that they
          were unripe, they declined several per cent.</p>

          <p>HALF PAST NINE.&#8212;The following telegram has just
          been received here.</p>

          <p>&quot;METZ, August 11th.</p>

          <p><i>&quot;To His Serene Highness, the Prince of Erie,
          Duke of the Grand Opera House, Admiral of Narragansett,
          Commander of the Ninth, etc., etc., etc., Erie Palace,
          New York City.</i></p>

          <p>&quot;ROYAL BROTHER:&#8212;Louis has received his
          baptism of fire. McMAHON wept. He is training to dispute
          with Miss LOUISA MOORE, the proud title of the
          &#39;Champion Weepist.&#39;</p>

          <p>&quot;Send me the Ninth, and the flower of <i>Opera
          Bouffe</i>&#8212;aye, even the great
          SCHNEIDER&#8212;shall be thine. &#39;Tis France that
          calls&#8212;be kind. Fraternally thine own,</p>

          <p>NAP.&quot;</p>

          <p>It was at first thought that H.S.H. would accede to
          the Emperor&#39;s request, his recent treaty with the
          Court of the <i>Grande Duchesse</i> and his diplomatic
          relations with the Viennoise Ballet Troupe having
          rendered the event far from improbable. It was also
          considered that the hostility which he has openly
          displayed towards the British Erie Protection Committee
          would predispose him in favor of England&#39;s natural
          enemy. In view of the possible departure of the Ninth,
          and the consequent prolongation of the European war, gold
          rose several degrees above freezing point.</p>

          <p>HALF PAST TEN.&#8212;Speculators in New York Central
          and Hudson River securities are much excited over a
          report that Commodore VANDERBILT had been seen to
          purchase a watering hose in the store of a well known
          manufacturer of gardening implements, on Broadway. He
          wrapped it in brown paper, placed it in his $1000 buggy,
          and drove away behind Dexter at the rate of 0:01-1/4 per
          minute. I have it on good authority that there is no
          truth in the rumor, circulated a few days ago, that the
          Commodore was engaged in negotiation with the Paid Fire
          Department for the use of their engines, etc., on some
          occasion not far distant.</p>

          <p>ELEVEN O&#39;CLOCK.&#8212;It is now officially
          announced that the watering hose referred to in my last
          is intended for gardening purposes only.</p>

          <p>HALF PAST ELEVEN.&#8212;Great war between Erie and the

          <p>TWELVE.&#8212;FISK says that the <i>Tribune</i> is so
          <i>heavy</i> that it <i>must</i> far the future be paid
          for by <i>weight</i>, on his steamers. It is felt that
          this course, if adopted by Mr. GREELEY, would be
          financially ruinous to the interests of his paper.</p>

          <p>HALF PAST TWELVE.&#8212;It is stated here that Mr.
          GREELEY, in the effectual disguise of a bran new hat and
          respectable boots, succeeded in smuggling a carpet bag
          filled with <i>Tribunes</i> on board the <i>Plymouth
          Rock</i>. Much anxiety is felt here concerning his fate,
          in case the Admiral should discover his presence on
          board.</p>

          <p>ONE O&#39;CLOCK.&#8212;In a letter just received, Mr.
          GREELEY designates the above report as &quot;a
          lie&#8212;a lie&#8212;false and malicious, and uttered

          <p>HALT PAST ONE.&#8212;For some days past a steady
          decline has been noticeable in Government securities; a
          want of confidence in the Executive is said to be the
          cause. It is reported that several of our leading
          financiers have openly indicated their dissatisfaction
          with the policy of those in power at Washington.</p>

          <p>Two O&#39;CLOCK.&#8212;The leading financier referred
          to in my last I find to be JAMES FISK, JR.</p>

          <p>HALF PAST TWO.&#8212;He indicated his dissatisfaction
          with the policy of the Government, to the President at
          Long Branch, thus: Having transferred all the jewels from
          his left hand to the right, and carefully adjusted them
          there, he raised the hand in question to his finely cut
          Roman nose, then, extending his fingers, he twirled them
          for several minutes without exhibiting any symptoms of
          fatigue. GRANT is said to have allowed a prime Partaga to
          drop from between his lips in his surprise.</p>

          <p>THREE O&#39;CLOCK.&#8212;It is now rumored that Fisk
          did not apply his fingers in the manner stated.</p>

          <p><b>THE WAY TO BECOME GREAT.</b></p>

          <p><img src="images/13.jpg" align="left" alt=
          "H">alf-witted people, only, will suppose I mean
          <i>grate</i>, for the most obtuse nincompoop must know
          that anybody can become a grate man by going into the
          stove business; but to develop yourself into a real
          <i>bonâ-fide</i> great man, like GEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN or
          DANIEL PRATT, requires much study and a persistent
          effort. I have carefully thought out this subject, and
          have reduced my reflections and observations to a series
          of rules, which, for the benefit of humanity, I propose
          to make public.</p>

          <p>It must he premised that there are many varieties of
          great men. Daddy LAMBERT was a great man, so was the
          living skeleton, yet even a casual observer could
          perceive the difference in their greatness. The greatness
          of the fleshy world is one thing; the greatness of the
          no-fleshy world is another. Also, strange as it may seem,
          a man may be great and yet not be great. HOOD was a great
          General, so was NAP 3, but they tell me that Nashville
          and Saarbrucken are terrible commentaries on greatness.
          Also a man may be great and not know it. They say that,
          until he had made his grand success at Fort Fisher, you
          never could persuade BUTLER that he was a great General.
          TUPPER, I am informed, would never believe that he was
          the most remarkable poet ever produced by England. Also a
          man may be great and be perfectly aware of it.
          Acquaintances of GEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN, Gen. O&#39;NEILL,
          and Count JOANNES, assert that no one knows, better than
          these gentlemen, that they are great men. Also a man may
          die calmly in the consciousness that he is a
          distinguished individual, and yet, years afterwards, some
          magazine writer may cast historic doubts upon his
          greatness.</p>

          <p>Of course there are several classes of great people.
          There is the little great man, (for example, NAP. 3,) the
          big great man, (BISMARCK,) the great little man, (NAP.
          1,) and the great big man, (the Onondaga giant.) But the
          patient observer must perceive that general rules will
          cover all these cases.</p>

          <p>It is to be hoped that no one, who shall become great
          by means of my rules, will turn upon me and revile me,
          when he finds himself interviewed incessantly, persecuted
          by unearthings of his early sins, by persistent beggars,
          by slanders of the envious, by libels of the press, and
          by the other concomitants of greatness. You must take the
          sour with the sweet. Even the sweetest orange may have an
          unpleasant rind.</p>

          <p>RULES BY WHICH EVERY MAN CAN BECOME GREAT.</p>

          <p>1. Always be sure to get what belongs to you, and make
          most vigorous grabs for everything that belongs to
          everybody else.</p>

          <p>2. Take everything which is offered to you, if it be
          on a par with what you deem the standard of your
          worth.</p>

          <p>This rule requires the exercise of much wisdom in its
          application. If, for example, you look upon the Custom
          House as the office which is adapted to you, don&#39;t,
          under any circumstances, take the appraiser&#39;s
          position. But you must never let the rule work the other
          way.</p>

          <p>3. Always have a policy. Talk about it much and often,
          and be sure to call it &quot;my policy.&quot;</p>

          <p>The best of rules being liable to misconstruction,
          some Congressmen have acted as if this rule read,
          &quot;Always have a policy shop.&quot;</p>

          <p>4. Always have a theory. If a murder has been
          committed, appear to know all about the &quot;dog,&quot;
          and to be familiar with its history from the time when it
          was a pup. Be sure to fix suspicion upon some person,
          even if you are compelled to eat your own words on the
          following day.</p>

          <p>5. Talk much and often about protection, and give
          advice to farmers, even if you don&#39;t know anything
          about agriculture.</p>

          <p>6. Fill your head with classical quotations, and trot
          them out on all occasions, whether discussing a bill for
          the diffusion of beans among the Indians, or the Alabama
          claims.</p>

          <p>7. Smoke many costly Havana cigars.</p>

          <p>This rule has been lately discovered.</p>

          <p>8. Get some one to write a history of CAESAR for you,
          or an account of a tour in the Highlands, and then claim
          the work as your own.</p>

          <p>There are one or two observations I would here make,
          which may be useful. If you are ambitious, you had better
          commence at the lower rounds of the ladder, in order that
          your ascent may be safe and rapid. If you would be, for
          instance, a great statesman, be first an alderman; if a
          great warrior, be first&#8212;well, say a tanner. Also,
          you should pay particular attention to the clothes which
          you inhabit. An old white hat and a slouchy old overcoat
          will insure you a nomination for the office of
          Governor.</p>

          <p>If, by following these rules and heeding these
          observations, you cannot become a great man, you may rest
          assured that the fault is not in the rules, but in you.
          What is already perfect cannot be made more perfect. If
          you fail, after conscientiously following the above
          advice, (though I&#39;m not sure that the fact will not
          be the same, if you succeed,) it&#39;s because you are
          already great&#8212;a great fool.</p>

          <p><b>&quot;THE COLORED TROOPS FOUGHT
          NOBLY.&quot;</b></p>

          <p>So far as the Franco-Prussian war has gone, the
          blackest page of its history appears to be the employment
          of the Turcos, who are nearly as black as average Nubian
          &quot;niggers.&quot; The expedient of mixing black troops
          with white was not very successful during our own little
          war. Raids upon hen-roosts were about the most prominent
          results of the experiment, though said raids were
          magnified by the Rads into grand victories over Confeds.
          The Turcos have done better, so far as mere fighting is
          concerned; but their brutal outrages exceed so greatly
          the hen-roost exploits of WENDELL PHILLIPS&#39;S devoted
          darkies, that they are certainly entitled to be organized
          into battalions bearing the title of the NAPOLEON Black
          Guards.</p>

          <p><b>A ROAR FROM NIAGARA</b>.</p>

          <p>DEAR PUNCHINELLO:&#8212;Having been reminded, by your
          recent notes on Niagara, that there is a cataract of that
          name, possessed of height and depth and breadth and
          volume and other well-known characteristics of a genuine
          Waterfall, I thought I would go and see it for myself.
          Not that I doubted your statements&#8212;which, indeed,
          are handsomely supported by familiar
          statistics,&#8212;but certainly there is a charm in
          treading the ground once trod by Greatness,
          breathing&#8212;well not the same air, I hope, but some
          of the same kind,&#8212;viewing the identical scenes, and
          being swindled by the self-same parties, that had just
          occasioned your animated comments.</p>

          <p>I don&#39;t know a charm at all comparable with that
          of being swindled in the midst of fine scenery, when the
          funds and enthusiasm still hold out, and the sense of
          actually getting the worth of one&#39;s money is not yet
          so blunted by transactions calculated to awaken Thought,
          as to have lost the power of increasing one&#39;s
          felicity. That the intelligent lad who drove me was in
          league with every one of the parties who were stationed
          here and there with the sole apparent purpose of
          receiving fifty cents from visitors, I was loth to
          believe, though nothing could have been plainer, if one
          had happened to think of it from the start.</p>

          <p>Is it not funny, the way they serve their Congress
          Water at the Cataract House? They put a big lump of ice
          in a tumbler, take a bottle from a shelf, pour the warm,
          stale fluid, (tasting like <i>perspiration</i>, as one
          might fancy,) into this glass, and expect you to wait
          till it has grown cool enough to be palatable. Well, if
          you wait, you lose what little life there is left in the
          stuff; and if you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll be sorry you
          hadn&#39;t done so.</p>

          <p>One may say, &quot;You needn&#39;t have ordered any
          Congress Water.&quot; Very well, but why not, provided I
          liked it? The clerk said they kept Vichy, also, but I
          learned they were &quot;out.&quot; I wish they had been
          out of Congress too. &quot;All right!&quot; said I,
          &quot;I shall enjoy my breakfast all the more, for I know
          <i>that</i> will make amends!&quot; And it did. The
          &quot;salmon trout&quot; was dry, as usual, but that
          breakfast was a good thing. I enjoyed it, and my two
          niggers and my New York paper of day before, (for which I
          paid a cute looking boy in the hall ten cents, on my way
          to breakfast,) and was happy.</p>

          <p>Not, my dear P., till I reached the &quot;other
          side,&quot; and had been inveigled into the Museum Hotel,
          and persuaded into those vile wrappings of oil-cloth,
          with the ponderous rubbers over my thick boots, and had
          stood around for some time, awaiting the pleasure of the
          very leisurely guide, sweating at every pore, (or
          <i>nearly</i> every one, for there are several millions,
          I believe, and I so hate exaggeration,) and trying to
          evade the glances of the amused bystanders, did I begin
          to realize the enormity of the imposition that had been
          practised on me. Just fancy <i>yourself</i>, Mr
          PUNCHINELLO, in such a costume, taking a seemingly
          interminable walk in a hot sun, down ever so many steps,
          encased in those nasty articles of gear, in the company
          of several other helpless unfortunates, wishing with all
          your might yon were already there!&quot;</p>

          <p>&quot;But the grandeur and glory of the adventure will
          console me!&quot; I murmured. Grandeur be hanged! A fig
          for the &quot;glory!&quot; What! do you call this
          &quot;going under the Falls,&quot;&#8212;that renowned
          journey, so full of peril? Pooh! merely standing in a
          bath-tub and letting somebody pull the string! You
          don&#39;t get quite so wet; that&#39;s all. Where&#39;s
          the &quot;danger,&quot; where&#39;s the
          &quot;glory,&quot; of merely stepping under a little
          spirt from one end of the Falls, with plenty of room to
          stand, and no darkness, no mystery, no nothing. Nothing
          but an overwhelming sense of being a cussed fool, and a
          simpleton, and a stupid, <i>and</i> a dunce!</p>

          <p>Oh, the going back, after that! in the same loathed
          costume, inwardly justifying the laughter of the knowing
          loungers as you ascend among them, and cursing yourself
          as the chief among ten thousand (ninnies,)&#8212;the one
          altogether idiotic.</p>

          <p>Except for this enormous swindle, dear P., I should
          have enjoyed Niagara, and Niagara would doubtless have
          enjoyed me. But this preposterous, disgusting,
          outrageous, ridiculous, contemptible, disgraceful,
          <i>unsurpassable</i> swindle prevented anything like a
          mutual understanding. I saw green in the Falls, the Falls
          saw green in me. The Falls kept coming down; I had
          already come down, (with my dollars,) and, in fact, was
          perpetually descending, with sums varying from
          twenty-five cents to four dollars and a half.</p>

          <p>My sole object, friend PUNCHINELLO, in addressing you
          on this subject, is to beg and beseech that you will warn
          the too-credulous and too-generous public against this
          unmatchably atrocious swindle of Going Under the Falls.
          It is too much for proud Humanity, Mr. P.! It is
          crushing! It is withering! It is annihilating! What!
          &quot;Annex&quot; this fraud? Never!&#8212;NEVER!</p>

          <p><b>THE POSSIBLE &quot;WHY?&quot; OF IT.</b></p>

          <p>The personal feeling against the French Emperor, so
          often displayed in the columns of the <i>Tribune</i>, has
          frequently been a subject of comment. Nevertheless it is
          easily accounted for. As Louis NAPOLEON is said to detest
          <i>ham</i>, ever since he was incarcerated in the
          fortress of that name, so does the Hon. HORACE GREELEY
          detest <i>him</i>, ever since he (H. G.) was arrested in
          France for some offence, real or imaginary, which we
          cannot now recall to mind, and thrown into prison at
          Clichy. And to this, also, may be traced the celebrated
          <i>bon mot of</i> Mr. GREELEY, who once remarked, on a
          festive occasion, that &quot;Ham was afflicted with
          <i>trichinosis</i> when it had Louis NAPOLEON in
          it.&quot;</p>

          <p><b>A HINT FOR EXCURSIONISTS.</b></p>

          <p>On account of the present nauseating condition of New
          York Bay, owing to the offal nuisance, no prudent voyager
          should seek to stem its feculent tide unless provided
          with &quot;something to take.&quot; An intelligent
          correspondent suggests that brandy would be about the
          thing, but that it should be labelled &quot;Bay
          Bum.&quot;</p>

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PUNCHINELLO, VOL. 1, NO. 24 ***

***** This file should be named 10032-h.htm or 10032-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Cornell University, Joshua Hutchinson, Steve Schulze and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
