      <p><b>THE</b></p>
      <p><b>MYSTERY OF MR. E. DROOD.</b></p>
      <p><b>AN ADAPTATION.</b></p>
      <p>BY ORPHEUS C. KERR.</p>
      <p>CHAPTER XII&#8212;(Continued.)</p>
      <p>The pauper burial-ground toward which they now progress in a
rather high-stepping manner, or&#8212;to vary the phrase&#8212;toward which their
steps are now very much bent, is not a favorite resort of the more
cheerful village people after nightfall. Ask any resident of
Bumsteadville if he believed in ghosts, and, if the time were mid-day
and the place a crowded grocery store, he would fearlessly answer in
the negative; (just the same as a Positive philosopher in cast-iron
health and with no thunder shower approaching would undauntedly deny a
Deity!) but if any resident of Bumsteadville should happen to be caught
near the country editor's last home after dark, he would get over that
part of his road in a curiously agile and flighty manner;&#8212;(just the
same as a Positive philosopher with a sore throat, or at an uncommonly
showy bit of lightning, would repeat "Now I lay me down to sleep," with
surprising devotion.) So, although no one in all Bumsteadville was in
the least afraid of the pauper burial-ground at any hour, it was not
invariably selected by the great mass of the populace as a peerless
place to go home by at midnight; and the two intellectual explorers
find no sentimental young couples rambling arm in arm among the ghastly
head-boards, nor so much as one loiterer smoking his segar on a
suicide's tomb.</p>
      <p>"JOHN McLAUGHLIN, you're getting nervous again," says Mr.
BUMSTEAD, catching him in the coat collar with the handle of his
umbrella and drawing the other toward him hand-over-hand. "It's about
time that you should revert again to the hoary JAMES AKER'S excellent
preparation for the human family.&#8212;I'll try it first, myself, to see if
it tastes at all of the cork.</p>
      <p>"Ah-h," sighs OLD MORTARITY, after his turn has come and been
enjoyed at last, "that's the kind of Spirits I don't mind being a
wrapper to. I could wrap <i>them</i> up all right."</p>
      <p>Reflectively chewing a clove, the Ritualistic organist
reclines on the pauper grave of a former writer for the daily press,
and cogitates upon his companion's leaning to Spiritualism; while the
other produces matches and lights their lanterns.</p>
      <p>"Mr. McLAUGHLIN," he solemnly remarks, waving his umbrella at
the graves around, "in this scene you behold the very last of man's
individual being. In this entombment he ends forever. Tremble, J.
McLAUGHLIN!&#8212;forever. Soul and Spirit are but unmeaning words, according
to the latest big things in science. The departed Dr. DAVIS SLAVONSKI,
of St. Petersburg, before setting out for the Asylum, proved, by his
Atomic Theory, that men are neatly manufactured of Atoms of matter,
which are continually combining together until they form Man; and then
going through the process of Life, which is but the mechanical effect
of their combination; and then wearing apart again by attrition into
the exhaustion of cohesion called Death; and then crumbling into
separate Atoms of native matter, or dust, again; and then gradually
combining again, as before, and evolving another Man; and Living, and
Dying, again; and so on forever. Thus, and thus only, is Man immortal.
You are made exclusively of Atoms of matter, yourself, JOHN McLAUGHLIN.
So am I."</p>
      <p>"I can understand a man's believing that <i>he, himself,</i>
is all Atoms of matter, and nothing else," responds OLD MORTARITY,
skeptically.</p>
      <p>"As how, JOHN McLAUGHLIN,&#8212;as how?"</p>
      <p>"When he knows that, at any rate, he hasn't got one atom of
common sense," is the answer.</p>
      <p>Suddenly Mr. BUMSTEAD arises from the grave and frantically
shakes hands with him.</p>
      <p>"You're right, sir!" he says, emotionally. "You're a
gooroleman, sir. The Atom of common sense was one of the Atoms that
SLAVONSKI forgot all about. Let's do some skeletons now."</p>
      <p>At the further end of the pauper burial-ground, and in the
rear of the former Alms-House, once stood a building used successively
as a cider-mill, a barn, and a kind of chapel for paupers. Long ago,
from neglect and bad weather, the frail wooden superstructure had
fallen into pieces and been gradually carted off; but a sturdy stone
foundation remained underground; and, although the flooring over it had
for many years been covered with debris and rank growth, so as to be
undistinguishable to common eyes from the general earth around it, the
great cellar still extended beneath, and, according to weird rumor, had
some secret access for OLD MORTARITY, who used it as a charnel
store-house for such spoils of the grave as he found in his prowlings.</p>
      <p>To the spot thus historied the two moralists of the moonlight
come now, and, with many tumbles, Mr. McLAUGHLIN removes certain
artfully placed stones and rubbish, and lifts a clumsy extemporized
trap-door. Below appears a ricketty old step-ladder leading into
darkness.</p>
      <p>"I heard such cries and groans down there, last Christmas Eve,
as sounded worse than the Latin singing in the Ritualistic church,"
observes McLAUGHLIN.</p>
      <p>"Cries and groans!" echoes Mr. BUMSTEAD, turning quite pale,
and momentarily forgetting the snakes which he is just beginning to
discover among the stones. "You're getting nervous again, poor wreck,
and need some more West Indian cough-mixture.&#8212;Wait until I see for
myself whether it's got enough sugar in it."</p>
      <p>In due time the great nervous antidote is passed and replaced,
and then, with the lighted lanterns worked around under their arms,
they go down the tottering ladder. Down they go into a great, damp,
musty cavern, to which their lights give a pallid illumination.</p>
      <p>"See here," says OLD MORTARITY, raising a long, curved bone
from the floor. "Look at that: shoulder-blade of unmarried Episcopal
lady, aged thirty-nine."</p>
      <p>"How do you know she was so old, and unmarried?" asks the
organist.</p>
      <p>"Because the shoulder-blade's so sharp."</p>
      <p>Mr. Bumstead is surprised at this specimen of the art of an
AGASSIZ and WATERHOUSE HAWKINS in such a mortary old man, and his
intellectual pride causes him to resolve at once upon a rival display.</p>
      <p>"Look at this skull, JOHN McLAUGHLIN," he says, referring to
an object that he has found behind the ladder. "See thish fine,
retreating brow, bulging chin, projecting occipital bone, and these
orifices of ears that musht've been stupen'sly long. It's the skull,
JOHN McLAUGHLIN, of a twin-brother of the man who really wished&#8212;really
wished, JOHN McLAUGHLIN&#8212;that he could be sat'shfied, sir, in his own
mind, that CHARLES DICKENS was a Christian writer."</p>
      <p>"Why, thash's skull of a hog," explains Mr. McLAUGHLIN, with
some contempt.</p>
      <p>"Twin-brother&#8212;all th'shame," says Mr. BUMSTEAD, as though that
made no earthly difference.</p>
      <p>Once more, what a strange expedition is this! How strangely
the eyes of the two men look, after two or three more applications to
the antique flask; and how curiously Mr. Bumstead walks on tip-toe at
times and takes short leaps now and then.</p>
      <p>"Lesh go now," says BUMSTEAD, after both have been asleep upon
their feet several times; "I think th's snakes down here, JOHN
McBUMSTEAD."</p>
      <p>"Wh'st! monkies, you mean,&#8212;dozens of black monkies, Mr.
BUMPLIN," whispers OLD MORTARITY, clutching his arm as he sinks against
him.</p>
      <p>"Noshir! Serp'nts!" insists Mr. BUMSTEAD, making futile
attempts to open his umbrella with one hand. "Warzesmarrer with th'
light?&#8212;ansh'r me t' once, Mac JOHNBUNKLIN!"</p>
      <p>In their swayings under the confusions and delusions of the
vault, their lanterns have worked around to the neighborhoods of their
spines, so that, whichever way they turn, the light is all behind them.
Greatly agitated, as men are apt to be when surrounded by supernatural
influences, they do not perceive the cause of this apparently unnatural
illumination; and, upon turning round and round in irregular circles,
and still finding the light in the wrong place, they exhibit signs of
great trepidation.</p>
      <p>"Warzemarrer wirra <i>light?</i>" repeats Mr. BUMSTEAD,
spinning wildly until he brings up against the wall.</p>
      <p>"Ishgotb'witched, I b'lieve," pants Mr. McLAUGHLIN, whirling
as frenziedly with his own lantern dangling behind him, and coming to
an abrupt pause against the opposite wall.</p>
      <p>Thus, each supported against the stones by a shoulder, they
breathe hard for a moment, and then sink into a slumber in which they
both slide down to the ground. Aroused by the shock, they sit up quite
dazed, brush away the swarming snakes and monkies, are freshly alarmed
by discovering that they are now actually sitting upon that perverse
light behind them, and, by a simultaneous impulse, begin crawling about
in search of the ladder. <span style="margin-left: 0.25em;">Unable to
see anything with all the light behind him, but fancying</span><br>
that he discerns a gleam beyond a dark object near at hand, Mr.
BUMSTEAD rises to a standing attitude by a series of complex
manoeuvres, and plants a foot on something.</p>
      <p>"I'morth'larrer!" he cries, spiritedly.</p>
      <p>"Th'larrer's on me!" answers Mr. MCLAUGHLIN, in evidently
great bewilderment.</p>
      <p>Then ensue a momentary wild struggle and muffled crash; for
each gentleman, coming blindly upon the other, has taken the light
glimmering at the other's back for the light at the top of the ladder,
and, further mistaking the other in the dark for the ladder itself, has
attempted to climb him. Mr. BUMSTEAD, however, has got the first step;
whereupon, Mr. MCLAUGHLIN, in resenting what he takes for the ladder's
inexcusable familiarity, has twisted both himself and his equally
deluded companion into a pretty hard fall.</p>
      <p>Another interval of hard breathing, and then the organist of
Saint Cow's asks: "Di'you hear anything drop?"</p>
      <p>"Yshir, th'larrer got throwed, f'rimpudence to a gen'l'm'n,"
is the peevish return of OLD MORTARITY, who immediately falls asleep as
he lies, with his lantern under his spine.</p>
      <p>In his sleep, he dreams that BUMSTEAD examines him closely,
with a view to gaining some clue to the mystery of the light behind
both their backs; and, on finding the lantern under him, and, studying
it profoundly for some time, is suddenly moved to feel along his own
back. He dreams that BUMSTEAD thereupon finds his own lantern, and
exclaims, after half an hour's analytical reflection, "It musht'ave
slid round while JOHN MCLAUGHLIN was intosh'cated." Then, or soon
after, the dreamer awakes, and can discern two Mr. BUMSTEADS seated
upon the step-ladders, with a lantern, baby-like, on each knee.</p>
      <p>"You two men are awake at last, eh?" say the organists, with
peculiar smiles.</p>
      <p>"Yes, gentlemen," return the MCLAUGHLINS, with yawns.</p>
      <p>They ascend silently from the cellar, each believing that he
is accompanied by two companions, and rendered moodily distrustful
thereby.</p>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Aina maina mona&#8212;Mike.</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bassalone, bona&#8212;Strike!"</span><br>
      <p>sings a small, familiar voice, when they stand again above
ground, and a stone whizzes between their heads.</p>
      <p>In another moment BUMSTEAD has the fell SMALLEY by the collar,
and is shaking him like a yard of carpet.</p>
      <p>"You wretched little tarrier!" he cries in a fury, "you've
been spying around to-night, to find out something about my
Spiritualism that may be distorted to injure my Ritualistic standing."</p>
      <p>"I ain't done nothing; and you jest drop me, or I'll knock
spots out of yer!" carols the stony young child. "I jest come to have
my aim at that old Beat there."</p>
      <p>"Attend to his case, then&#8212;his and his friend's, for he seems
to have some one with him&#8212;and never let me see you two boys again."</p>
      <p>Thus Mr. BUMSTEAD, as he releases the excited lad, and turns
from the pauper burial-ground for a curious kind of pitching and
running walk homeward. The strange expedition is at an end:-but <i>which</i>
end he is unable just then to decide.</p>

cousin in the country whenever you think she would like it, except when
Mr. PUNCHINELLO is present. If that gallant gentleman is at hand,
escort duty may, with perfect propriety, be left to him.</p>
      <p><i>Charles</i> inquires whether his handwriting is good enough
to qualify him for membership in a base ball club. We think he is all
right on that score.</p>
      <p><i>Glaucus.</i>&#8212;We have never heard that Newport is a good
place for gathering sea-shells, but we presume you can shell out there
if you wish.</p>
      <p><i>Chapeau</i>.&#8212;Hats will be worn on the head this season. It
is not considered stylish to hang them on the ear, eyebrow, or coat
collar.</p>
      <p><i>Cit.</i>&#8212;The correct dimensions of a Saratoga pocket-book
have not been definitely decided. As to sending it, it is doubtful
whether the rail-road companies would receive it as baggage. Perhaps
you could charter a canal boat.</p>
      <p><i>Aspirant</i>.&#8212;We cannot tell you the price of "bored" in
Washington "for a few weeks." No doubt you could get liberally bored at
a reasonable rate.</p>
      <p><i>Sorosis</i>&#8212;It was very wrong for your husband to mention

such troubles without creating a public scandal.</p>
      <p><i>Butcher Boy</i>.&#8212;You cannot succeed as a writer of "lite
comidy" if you continue to weave such tragic spells. "The Lean Larder"
would not be an attractive title for your play.</p>
      <p><i>C. Drincarty</i> submits the following problem: If one
swallow don't make a summer, how many claret punches can a man take
before fall? Will some of our ingenious readers offer a suitable
solution?</p>
      <p><i>Culturist</i>.&#8212;The potato has been grafted with great
success on the cucumber tree in some of the Western States. The stock
should be heated by a slow fire until the sap starts. The grafts should
be boiled in a preparation known to science as vanilla cream.</p>
      <p><i>Truth</i>.&#8212;Your information is not authentic. LOUIS
NAPOLEON never played marbles in Central Park, nor took his little Nap
in the vestibule of WOOD'S Museum.</p>
      <p><i>Fanny</i> inquires whether "ballot girls" are wanted in New
York. Wyoming is a better field for them than this city.</p>
      <p><i>Maine Chance</i> has been paying his <i>devoirs</i> with
great impartiality to two young ladies. One of them has red hair and a
Roman nose, but the paternal income is very handsome. The other is
witty and pretty, but can bring no rocks, except possibly "Rock the
cradle." Recently he called on the golden girl, and a menial rudely
repulsed him from the door. This hurt his feelings. He then went to the
dwelling of the Fair, when a big dog attacked him "on purpose," and
lacerated his trousers. He wants to know whether he has any remedy in
the courts. His best way is the way home.</p>
      <p><i>Rifleman</i>.&#8212;You are right; the rival guns&#8212;the Dreyse and
the Chassepot&#8212;are also rifle-guns. Both of them are provided with
needles, as you suppose, but, so far as there is any chance of their
being put to the test under present circumstances, in Europe, it rather
appears that both of them will prove Needless.</p>
      <p><i>Piscator</i>.&#8212;No; the weak-fish is not so called on account
of any supposed feebleness attributable to it. If you take a round of
the markets one of these roaring hot days, your senses will tell you
that the weakfish is sometimes very strong.</p>

      <p><b>THE PLAYS AND SHOWS.</b></p>
      <p><img src="images/05.jpg" align="left" alt="A">s a good many
persons know, LA GISELLE is a ballet whose hundred legs are nightly
displayed on the stage of the GRAND OPERA HOUSE.</p>
      <p>The <i>Twelve Temptations</i> have ceased to tempt, and the
familiar legs of LUPE no longer allure. But in their place we have
KATHI LANNER, and BERTHA LIND, and nearly a gross of assorted legs of
the very best quality.</p>
      <p>Why do the women clamor for the ballot, when they have almost
exclusive possession of the ballet? The latter is much nicer and more
useful than the former. The average repeater can obtain only a dollar
for his ballot, but the average ballet will find any quantity of
enthusiastic admirers at one dollar and a half a head. Would any man
pay KATHI LANNER a dollar for the privilege of seeing her with a ballot
in her hand?</p>
      <p>On the other hand, lives there a man with eyes so dead that he
would not cheerfully pay twice that sum to see her in the mazes of the
ballet?</p>
      <p>But <i>La Giselle</i>? Certainly. I am coming to that in a
moment. I have often thought that nature must have intended me for a
writer of sermons. I have such a facility for beginning an article with
a series of general remarks that have nothing whatever to do with the
subject.</p>
      <p>Though how can any one be rationally expected to stick to
anything in this weather, except, perhaps, the newly varnished surface
of his desk? And how can even the firmest of resolutions be prevented
from melting and vanishing away, with the thermometer at more degrees
than one likes to mention? You remember the old proverb: "Man proposes,
but his mother-in-law finally disposes." The bearing of this
observation lies in its application.</p>
      <p>By the bye, I don't know a better application, in the present
weather, than claret punch. Apply yourself continually to that cooling
beverage, and apply it continually to your lips, and the result is a
sort of reciprocity treat, whose results are much more certain than
those of the reciprocity treaty, of which Congress has latterly had so
much to say.</p>
      <p>To contemplate <i>La Giselle</i> in all its bearings is a
pleasure which is peculiarly appropriate to the season. KATHI LANNER
and her companions may not be really cool, but they look as though they
were. They remind one of the East Indian country houses that are built
on posts, so as to allow a free circulation of air beneath the
foundation. Anyhow, they look as if they took things coolly.</p>
      <p>(A joke might be made on the words coolly and Coolie. The
reader may mix to his own taste. It's too hot for any one to make jokes
for other people.)</p>
      <p>But <i>La Giselle</i>? Yes! yes! I am just ready to speak of
it. <i>La Giselle</i> is a grand ballet in which an elaborate plot is
developed by the toes of some fifty young ladies. There is a young
woman in it who loves a man, and there is another woman who also loves
him, and another man who loves the first woman, and meddles and mars as
though he were a professional philanthropist.</p>
      <p>The woman&#8212;the first woman, I mean&#8212;goes crazy down to the
extremity of her feet, and dies, and then there are more women,&#8212;no;
these last are disembodied spirits, with nothing but light skirts
on,&#8212;who dance in graveyards, and make young men dance with them till
they fall down exhausted, calling in vain for BROWN to take them home
in carriages, and pay for their torn gloves. The first young woman, and
a young man&#8212;not the other young man, you understand&#8212;does a good deal
of&#8212;Well, in fact, things are rather mixed before the ballet comes to an
end, but I know that it's a good thing, for FISK sits in his private
box and applauds it, which he wouldn't do if he didn't.</p>
      <p>And now, having placed <i>La Giselle</i> plainly before your
mental vision, I desire to rise to a personal explanation. For the
ensuing four weeks, the places, in <b>PUNCHINELLO</b>, which have
heretofore known me, will know me no more. I am going to a quiet
country place on Long Island to write war correspondence for the&#8212;well,
I won't mention the name of the paper. You see the editor of the <i>Na----</i>
of the paper in question, I should say,&#8212;wants to have an independent
and unprejudiced account of the great struggle on the Rhine&#8212;something
that shall be different from any other account.&#8212;Down on Long Island, I
shall be out of the reach of either French or Prussian influence, and
will be able to describe events as they should be. I have made
arrangements with the "Veteran Observer" of the <i>Times</i> to take
charge of this column during my absence. If he can only curb his
natural tendency toward frivolity and jocoseness, I am in hopes that he
will be able to draw his salary as promptly and efficiently as though
he were a younger man. Remarking, therefore, in the words of <i>Kathleen
Mavourneen</i>, that my absence "may be four weeks, and it may be
longer," I bid my readers a warm (thermometer one hundred and five
degrees) farewell.</p>

      <p><b>JUPITER BELLICOSUS.</b></p>
      <p>Truly, <b>PUNCHINELLO</b>, this is an age of progress. Wars
of succession are no more. Absolutism must forever hang its head. Fling
a glance at France; peer into Prussia, <i>Vox populi</i> is the voice
of the King, and the voice of the king is therefore <i>vox Dei</i>.
When a king speaks for his people he must speak sooth; what he says of
other peoples must be taken with a grain of salt. Bearing this in mind,
the apparent inconsistency between the regal rigmarole and the Imperial
improvisation (these epithets are a tribute to the Republic) which I
have received by our <i>special wire</i> from Europe were addressed by
the monarchs to their respective armies before the grand "wiring in"
which is to follow.</p>
      <p>WILHELM KOENIG VON PRUSSEN.</p>
      <p><i>Soldaten</i>: The Gaul is at our gates. <i>Vaterland</i>
is in danger: my <i>weiss</i> is then for war. France, led by a
despot, is about to desecrate the Rhine. His imperial bees are
swarming, but we shall send him back with his bees in his bonnet, and a
bee's mark (BISMARCK) on the end of his nasal organ. France wars for
conquest; Prussia never. When FREDERICK the Great captured Silesia from
a Roman without any apparent pretext, was he not an instrument of
Providence? When, in company with Austria, we beat and bullied Denmark
out of Schleswig-Holstein, were we not victorious, and is not that
sufficient justification? When we afterwards beat this Austria, did it
not serve her right? And when we absorbed Hanover, &amp;c., was it not
to protect them? Yes, our present object is the defence of our country
and the capture of Alsace and Lorraine, which mere politeness prevented
us from claiming hitherto. On, then, soldiers of Deutchland. Let our <i>law
reign</i> in Lorraine, for what is sauce for the Prussian goose should
be Alsace for the Gallic gander. The God of battles is on the side of
our just cause; Leipsic is looking at us, Waterloo is watching us. GOTT
      <i>und</i> WILHELM, <i>sauerkraut und schnapps. Vorwarts.</i></p>
      <p>NAPOLEON, EMPEREUR DES FRANCAIS.</p>
      <p><i>Soldats:</i> True to your trust in me, I am about to lead
you to slaughter. <i>L'Empire c'est la paix</i>. Prussia would place a
poor and distant relative of mine on the throne of Spain, therefore
must we recover the natural frontier of France, which lies upon the
Rhine. The rhino is ready, and we are ready for the Rhine. Let my red
republican subjects recall Valmy and Jemappes, and their generals
KELLERMANN and DUMAURIOZ. Let every Frenchman kill a Prussian, every
woman too <i>kill her man</i>. They did much for <i>la patrie</i> in
those days, but do <i>more ye to-day</i>. France wars for ideas only;
Prussia for rapine. We have heard this Rhine-whine long enough; it has
got into our heads at last.</p>
      <p>The spirit of my uncle has its eye upon you. Ambition was no
part of his nature. His struggles were all for the good of France,
"which he loved so much," as he himself said at his country-seat at St.
Helena. Marshal, then, to the notes of the <i>Marseillaise</i>, which
I now generously permit you to sing.</p>
      <p>The Gallic rooster shall "cackle, cackle, clap his wings and

      <p><b>THE POEMS OF THE CRADLE.</b></p>
      <p>CANTO II.</p>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Hey! Diddle diddle, the cat
and the fiddle</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">The cow jumped over the moon.</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">The little dog laughed to see
the sport,</span><br>
      <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the dish ran after the spoon."</span><br>
      <p>These were the classic expressions of the hilarious poet of a
period far back in the vista of ages. How vividly they portray the
exalted state of his mind; and how impressed the public must have been
at the time; for did not the words become popular immediately, and have
they not so continued to the present day?</p>
      <p>Every mother immediately seized upon the verse, and, setting
it to music of her own, sang it as a cradle song to soothe the troubles
of infanthood, and repeated it in great glee to the intelligent babe
when in a crowing mood, as the poem most fitted for the infant's brain
to comprehend.</p>
      <p>Papa, anxious to watch the unfolding of the human mind, and
its gradual development, would take the baby-prodigy in his arms, and
with keen glance directed upon its face, repeat, in thrilling tones,
the sublime words. With what joy would he remark and comment upon any
gleam of intelligence, and again and again would he recite, in an
impressive voice, those words so calculated to aid in bringing into
blossom the bud of promise.</p>
      <p>But who can meditate upon the memorable stanzas, and not see,
in fancy, the enthusiastic youth&#8212;the lover of melody and of nature&#8212;as
he enters his dingy room, the ordinary abiding place of poetical
geniuses. He sees his beloved fiddle, and his no less beloved feline
friend, in loving conjunction; he bursts out rapturously with impetuous
joy:</p>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">"Hey! diddle diddle, the cat
and the fiddle!"</span><br>
      <p>He sees the two things dearest to his heart, and sees them
both at one time! And he must be excused for his sudden night into the
regions of classicism.</p>
      <p>No wonder that he immediately imagines the world to be as full
of joy as he himself, and that he thinks</p>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.75em;">"The cow jumped over the moon."</span><br>
      <p>Perhaps the sight was a sufficient re-moon-eration to him for
his past troubles; and the exhilaration of his spirits caused him to
dance, to cut pigeon-wings, and otherwise gaily disport himself;
consequently,</p>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.75em;">"The little dog laughed to see
the sport,"</span><br>
      <p>which every intelligent dog would have done, under the
circumstances. Certainly, dear reader, you would have done so yourself.</p>
      <p>The hilariousness of the poet increasing, and his joyfulness
expanding, his manifestations did not confine themselves to simple
dancing-steps and an occasional pigeon-wing, but, inadvertently
perhaps, he introduced the "can-can," and that explains why</p>
      <span style="margin-left: 1.75em;">"The dish ran away with the
spoon."</span><br>
      <p>For the end of his excited toe came in contact with his only
dish and spoon, and propelled them to the other side of the room. As he
does not tell us whether the dish remained whole after its escapade, we
must conclude that it was broken, and that the dreadful accident
caused, immediately, a damp to descend upon his effervescent spirits.</p>
      <p>In what better way could he give vent to his feelings than in
descriptive verse? He could not shed his tears upon the paper and hand
them around for inspection, or write a melancholy sonnet on the frailty
of crockery, as a relief to his mind. No! he chose the course best
fitted to command public attention, as the result proved. He told his
tale&#8212;its cause and effect&#8212;in as few words as possible. Fortunate if
other poets would only do the same!</p>

      <p><b>THE MISERIES OF A HANDSOME MAN.</b></p>
      <p>Ever since my earliest recollections I have been a victim to
circumstances.</p>
      <p>Beauty, which others desire and try every means to obtain, to
me has been a source of untold misery. From my infancy, when ugly women
with horrid breaths would stop my nurse in the streets and insist upon
kissing me&#8212;through my school-days, when the girls would pet me and
offer me a share of their nuts and candies, and the boys laugh at me in
consequence, and call me "gal-boy," squirt ink upon my face for
beauty-spots, and present me with curl-papers and flowers for my
hair&#8212;until the present, when I am denied introductions to young ladies
and am put off on old women&#8212;I have suffered for my looks.</p>
      <p>In my boarding-house I am shunned as if I had the plague. When
I enter the parlor or dining-room, I see the ladies look at each other
with a knowing air, as much as to say, "Look at him!" And the answer is
telegraphed back, "Ain't he handsome? but he knows it," as if I could
help knowing it with every one telling me so fifty times a day; and
husbands pay unusual attention to their wives when I am around, as if I
were an ogre.</p>
      <p>I am naturally a modest man, made more so by my extreme
sensitiveness to personal criticism; and to be obliged to stand
apparently unconscious, when I know I am being looked at and commented
upon, is harrowing to my feelings. I feel sometimes as if I should drop
down on the floor, but then folks would never stop laughing if I did,
at what they would be pleased to term my extreme ladylikeness! I have
actually prayed that I might get the small-pox, and once walked through
the small-pox hospital for that purpose, but escaped unharmed.</p>
      <p>I suppose I must have been vaccinated. In fact, I know I have
been, for how often have I looked at the scar on my arm, and wished it
had been on my cheek, or at the end of my nose, or, in fact, on any
place where it might be considered a blemish.</p>
      <p>When I was a child I came near killing myself one night by
going to bed with two large bottle-corks thrust into my nostrils, to
make them large, like other boys'; and have made my mouth sore by
stretching it with my fingers, or forcing melon-rinds into it, to
enlarge it. But it was useless; perhaps the mouth might be sore for a
couple of days, but its shape remained unaltered.</p>
      <p>Now that I am a man, I am as unfortunate as ever. My hair <i>will</i>
curl, even when shaved within half-an-inch of the scalp; my moustache
will stay jet-black, although I sometimes wax the ends of it with soap,
and walk on the sunny side of Broadway; my teeth are perfect, and I
never need a dentist; and my hands are shameful for a man,&#8212;so all my
old-maid-aunts and bachelor-uncles say.</p>
      <p>My affections have been trifled with several times, "because,"
as they said, "when they had drawn me to the proposing point, I was too
handsome to be good for anything as a husband&#8212;I did very well for a
beau." Goodness! is it only ugly men that can marry? I want to marry
and settle down; for I am so slighted in society that I look with envy
upon homely or mis-shapen men.</p>
      <p>But who will have me? I put it to you, my friend, if it isn't
a hard case. I want an intelligent and agreeable wife, and one that
comes of a respectable family. I don't think I am asking too much, but
it seems fate has determined such a one I can never have! I have either
to remain single, or take one that is "ignorant and vulgar." That, of
course, would be as much remarked upon as my appearance, so it cannot
be thought of.</p>
      <p>I want to escape observation and criticism. I think strongly
of emigrating to the Rocky Mountains, donning a rough garb, and digging
for gold, in the hope of getting round-shouldered; or hiring myself out
as a wood-chopper, in anticipation of a chip flying up and taking off
part of my obnoxious nose.</p>
      <p>If there were no women around, I might escape notice out
there. But if one happened to come along, I should be obliged to leave,
for her eyes would ferret out my unfortunate peculiarities, and all my
wounds would be opened afresh. Sometimes I think there is no spot on
the globe where I would be welcomed; and I feel inclined to commit some
desperate deed, that I may be arrested and confined out of the sight of
man and woman-kind, until I am aged and bent enough to be presentable.</p>

      <p>Passing down Chatham street the other day, PUNCHINELLO stopped
in front of a window where hung a highly-colored engraving of an
Austrian sovereign engaged in the Easter ceremony of washing the feet
of twelve old men and women.</p>
      <p>An Irishman at our side, who had been puzzling some time to

explained, "typical of the washing of the feet of the Twelve Apostles."</p>
      <p>PAT eyed PUNCHINELLO askance with an expression which plainly

      <p><b>FROM AN ANXIOUS MOTHER TO HER DAUGHTER.</b></p>
      <p>[Who is at a Watering Place.]</p>
      <p>NEW YORK, July 12, 1870.</p>
      <p>MY DEAR DAUGHTER: How are you getting on, dear? Well, I hope,
for you know I <i>do</i> want to get you off, desperately.
Thirty-seven, and still on my hands! Mr. GUSHER, of the
Four-hundred-and-thirty-ninth Avenue, goes down next Saturday. He will
hunt you up. Mr. GUSHER is a nice man&#8212;so sympathetic and kind; and has
such a lovely moustache. Besides, my dear SOPHY, he has oceans of
stamps. Quite true, my child, he hasn't much of anything else, but
girls at thirty-seven must not have too sharp eyes, nor see too much.
Do, dear, try and fix him if you can. Put all your little artifices
into effect. Walk, if possible, by moonlight, and alone; that is, with
him. Talk, as you know you can, of the sweets of love and the delights
of home. Dwell on the felicities of love in a cottage, and if he
doesn't see it, dilate on the article in a brown-stone front, with
marble steps. Picture to him in the most glowing terms the joys of the
fireside, with fond you by his side. If he hints that a fireside in
July is slightly tepid, thoughtfully suggest that it is merely a figure
of speech, and introduce an episode of cream to cool it. Quote
vehemently from TENNYSON, and LONGFELLOW, and Mrs. BROWNING. Bring the
artillery of your eyes to bear squarely on the mark. Remember that
thirty-seven years and an anxious mother are steadily looking down upon
you.</p>
      <p>Cut SMIRCH. SMIRCH is a worthless fellow. Would you believe
it? his father makes boot-pegs for a living. The house of WIGGINS
cannot consort with the son of one who pegs along in life in this
manner! Never. Banish SMIRCH. Don't let SMIRCH even look at your
footprints on the beach.</p>
      <p>Then there is Mr. BLUSTER. What is he? Who? Impertinent puppy!
Pretended to own a corner-house on the Twenty-fifth Avenue, and wanted
to know how <i>I</i> should like it? Like it? I should like to see him
in Sing-Sing! <i>He</i> own a house?&#8212;a brass foundry more like, and
that in his face! Keep a sharp eye on BLUSTER and his blarney. He's
what our neighbor GINGER calls a "beat," whatever that is&#8212;a squash, no
doubt.</p>
      <p>Don't spare any pains, my dear, for a market. I was only
twenty-six when I married the late lamented Mr. WIGGINS. And a dear
good man he was&#8212;only I wish he had paid his bills at the corner
groceries. How he <i>did</i> love, my dear&#8212;that favorite demijohn in
the corner! And then when he came home at night with such a smile&#8212;he'd
been taking them all day. Don't fail to catch somebody. GUSHER, depend,
is the man. Money is everything. Never mind what he hasn't got just
under the hat. It is the pocket you must aim at. What is life and
society&#8212;what New York&#8212;without money? Say you love him to distraction.
Declare your existence is bound up in his. (Greenback binding.) Throw
yourself at his feet at the opportune moment, and victory must be
yours. Impale him at all hazards. Remember you are thirty-seven and
well on in life. Your own loving</p>
      <p>MARIA ANASTASIA WIGGINS.</p>

      <p><b>HIRAM GREEN'S EXPERIENCE AS AN EDITOR.</b></p>
      <p>Lively Times in the Editorial Sanctum.&#8212;The "Lait Gustise"
handled Roughly.</p>
      <p>"Whooray! Whooray!" I exclaimed, rushin' into the kitchen
door, one mornin' last spring, and addressin' Mrs. GREEN. "I've been
invited to edit the <i>Skeensboro Fish Horn</i>. Fame, madam, awaits
your talented pardner."</p>
      <p>"Talented Lunkhead, you mean," said this interestin' femail;
"you'd look sweet editin' a noose paper. So would H. WARD BEECHER
dancin' 'shoo-fly' along with DAN BRYANT. Don't make a fool of yourself
if you know anything, HIRAM, and respect your family."</p>
      <p>The above conversation was the prelude to my first and last
experience in editin' a country paper.</p>
      <p>The editor of the "Fish Horn" went on a pleasure trip, to
plant a rich ant who had died and left him some cash.</p>
      <p>Durin' his absence I run his paper for him. Seatin' my form
on top of the nail keg, with shears and paste brush I prepared to show
this ere community how to run a noosepaper.</p>
      <p>I writ the follerin' little squibs and put 'em in my first
issue.</p>
      <p>"If a sertin lite complexion man wouldn't run his hands down
into sugar barrels so often, when visitin' grosery stores, it would be
money in the pocket of the Skeensboro merchants"&#8212;</p>
      <p>"Query. Wonder how a farmer in this town, whose name we will
not rite, likes burnin' wood from his nabor's wood-pile?"&#8212;</p>
      <p>"We would advise a sertin toothles old made to leave off
paintin' her cheeks, and stop slanderin' her nabors. If she does so,
she will be a more interestin' femail to have around."&#8212;</p>
      <p>"Stop Thief.&#8212;If that Deekin, who trades at one of our grocery
stores, and helps himself to ten cents worth of tobacker while buyin'
one cents worth of pipes, will devide up his custom, it would be doing
the square thing by the man who has kept him in tobacker for several
years."</p>
      <p>These articles was like the bustin' of a lot of bombshells in
this usually quiet boro.</p>
      <p>The Deekins called a church meetin', and played a game of old
sledge, to see who would call and demand satisfaction for the insult.
As they all smoked, they couldn't tell who was hit, as their tobacker
bill was small all around.</p>
      <p>Deekin PERKINS got beat when they come to "saw off."</p>
      <p>Said this pious man:</p>
      <p>"If old GREEN don't chaw his words, I'll bust his gizzard."</p>
      <p>The farmers met at SIMMINSES store. After tryin' on the
garment about steelin' wood, it was hard to decide who the coat fit the
best, but each one made up his mind to pay off an old grudge and "pitch
into the Lait Gustise."</p>
      <p>All the old mades met together in the village milliner shop,
where the Sore-eye-siss society held meetin's once a week, and their
false teeth trembled like a rattlesnake's tail, when they read my
artickle about old mades.</p>
      <p>It was finally resolved by this anshient lot of caliker to
"stir up old GREEN."</p>
      <p>Headed by SARY YOUMANS, the crossest old made in the U.S., and
all armed with broom-sticks and darnin'-needles, the door of my
editorial offis was busted open, and the whole caboodle of wimmen,
famishin' for my top hair, entered.</p>
      <p>They foamed at the mouth like a pack of dissappinted
Orpheus&#8212;C&#8212;Kerrs, as they brandished their wepins over my bald head.</p>
      <p>"Squire GREEN," sed a maskaline lookin' specimen of time worn
caliker, holdin' a copy of the <i>Fish Horn</i> in her bony fingers,
"did you rite that 'ere?"</p>
      <p>"Wall," sed I, feelin' somewhat riled at the sassy crowd,
"s'posen I did or didn't, what on it?"</p>
      <p>"We are goin' to visit the wrath of a down-trodden rase upon
your frontispiece, that's what we is, d'ye hear, old Pilgarlick?" said
the exasperated 16th Amendmenter, as she brought down her gingham
umbrella over my shoulders.</p>
      <p>At this they all rushed for me. With paste-brush and shears I
kept them off, until somebody pushed me over a woman who had got
tripped up, when the army of infuriated Amazons piled onto my aged form.</p>
      <p>This round dident last more'n two minutes, for as soon as they
got me down, they all stuck their confounded needles into me, and then
left me lookin' more like a porkupine than a human bein'.</p>
      <p>I hadent more'n had time to pull out a few quarts of needles,
before in walks 2 big strappin' farmers.</p>
      <p>"Old man, we've come for you," said one of 'em. "We'll larn
you to slander honest fokes."</p>
      <p>At this he let fly his rite bute at my cote skirts.</p>
      <p>I was home-sick, you can jest bet. Then t'other chap let me
have it.</p>
      <p>"Down stairs with him," sed they both, and down I went, pooty
lively for an old man.</p>
      <p>Just as I got to the bottom I lit on a man's head. It was
Deekin PERKINS comein' to "bust my gizzard."</p>
      <p>"Hevings and airth," sed the Deekin as he tumbled over in the
entry way. I jumped behind a door, emejutly, and as the farmers
proceeded to polish off the Deekin, I was willin' to forgive both of
'em, as the Deekin groaned and yelled.</p>
      <p>Yes siree! it was soothin' fun for me, to see them farmers
welt the Deekin.</p>
      <p>Steelin' up stairs agin, I was brushin' off my clothes, when
in walks EBENEZER.</p>
      <p>"Sawtel," said he, ceasin' me by the cote coller and shakin'
me, "Ile larn you to rite about steelin' sugar; take that&#8212;and that," at
which he let fly his bute, and down stairs I went agin&#8212;Eben urgin' me
on with his bute.&#8212;</p>
      <p>Suffice to say, the whole village called on me that day, and I
was kicked down stairs 32 times by the watch.&#8212;Hosswhipt by 17
wimmen&#8212;besides bein' stuck full of needles by a lot more.</p>
      <p>I got so used to bein' kicked down stairs, that evry time a
man come in the door, I would place my back towards him and sing out:</p>
      <p>"Kick away, my friend, I'm in the Editorial biziness
to-day&#8212;to-morrow I go hents&#8212;there's rather too much exsitement runnin'
a noosepaper, and I shall resine this evenin."</p>
      <p>When I got home that nite, I looked like an angel carryin' a
palm-leaf fan in his hand, and clothed in purple and fine linen. My
body was purpler than a huckleberry pie, and my linen was torn into
pieces finer than a postage-stamp.</p>
      <p>"Sarved you rite, you old fool," said Mrs. GREEN, as she stood
rubbin' camfire onto me. "In ritin' noosepaper articles, editors orter
name their man. A shoe which hain't bilt for anybody in particular,
will get onto evrybody in general's foot. When it does, the bilder had
better get ready for numerous bootin's, from that self-same shoe."</p>

      <p><b>COMIC ZOOLOGY</b></p>
      <p>Order, Cetacea.&#8212;The Right (and wrong) Whale.</p>
      <p>The largest of the Cetacea is the Right whale, of which&#8212;so
persistently is it hunted down&#8212;there will soon be but few Left. Some
flippant jokist has remarked that there is no Wrong whale, but this is
all Oily Gammon. There is a right and a wrong to everything&#8212;not
excepting the leviathan of the deep.</p>
      <p>By the courtesy of the Fisheries, the planting of a harpoon in
the vitals of a Right whale gives the planter a pre-emption claim to
it. If subsequently appropriated by another party it becomes, so far as
that party is concerned, the Wrong whale, and on Trying the case its
value may be recovered in a court of law,&#8212;with Whaling costs.</p>
      <p>The sperm whale, or cachalot, (genus <i>physeter</i>) is a
rare visitor in the higher latitudes. Now and then a solitary specimen
is taken in the Northern Atlantic, but the best place to catch a lot is
on the Pacific coast. It may be mentioned incidentally, as a curious
meteorological coincidence, that Whales and Waterspouts are invariably
seen together, and hence it was, (perhaps,) that the long-necked cloud
pointed out by HAMLET to POLONIUS, reminded that old Grampus of a Whale.</p>
      <p>The favorite food of the great marine mammal of the Pacific is
the Squid, and as this little creature swarms in the vicinity of
Hawaii, the cachalot instinctively goes there at certain seasons to
chew its Squid by way of a Sandwich.</p>
      <p>Although the capture of the whale involves an immense amount
of Paying Out before anything can be realized, it has probably always
been a lucrative pursuit. The great fish seems, however, to have
yielded the greatest Prophet in the days of JONAH. No man since then
has enjoyed the same facilities for forming a true estimate of the
value of the monster, that were vouchsafed to that singular man.
Perhaps during his visit to Nineveh he entertained the Ninnies with a
learned lecture on the subject, but if so, it has not turned up to
reward the research of modern Archaeologists. LAYARD found the word
JONAH inscribed among the ruins of the old Assyrian city, but the name
of the ancient mariner was unaccompanied by any mention of the whale.</p>
      <p>All the whale family, though apparently phlegmatic, are
somewhat given to Blowing up, and, when about to die, instead of taking
the matter coolly and philosophically, they are always terribly
Flurried. In fact, the whale, when in <i>articulo mortis</i>, makes a
more tremendous rumpus about its latter end than any other animal
either of the sea or land.</p>
      <p>The Right whale, though many people make Light of it, is
unquestionably the heaviest of living creatures. Scales never contained
anything so ponderous. But while conceding to Leviathan the proud title
of Monarch of the Deep, it should be remarked that it has a rival on
the land, known as Old King Coal, that completely takes the Shine out
of it.</p>

      <p><b>THE WATERING PLACES.</b></p>
      <p><b>Punchinello's Vacations.</b></p>
      <p>At Newport, one cannot fail to perceive a certain atmosphere
of blue blood&#8212;but it must not be understood, from this expression, that
the air is filled with cerulean gore. Mr. P. merely wished to remark
that the society at that watering place is very aristocratic. He felt
the influence himself, although he staid there only a few days. His
aristocratic impulses all came out. Whether they staid out or not
remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>But no matter. He found many of the best people in Newport,
and he felt congenial. When a fellow sits at his wine with men like
JOHN T. HOFFMAN, and AUGUST BELMONT, and PARAN STEVENS; and takes the
air with Mrs. J.F., Jr., behind her delightful four-in-hand, he is apt
to feel a little "uppish." If anyone doubts it let him try it. At the
Atlantic Hotel they gave Mr. P. the room which had been recently
vacated by Gov. PADELFORD. He was glad to hear this. He liked the room
a great deal better when he heard that the Governor wasn't there any
more.</p>
      <p>The first walk that he took on the beach proved to him that
this was no place for illiterate snobs and shoddyites. Everybody talked
of high moral aims, or questions of deep import, (especially the high
tariff Congressmen,) and even the little girls who were sitting in the
shade, (with big white umbrellas over them to keep the freckles off,)
were puzzling their heads over charades and enigmas, instead of running
around and making little Frou-Frous of themselves. Mr. P. composed an
enigma for a group of these young students. Said he:</p>
      <blockquote> "My first is a useless expense.<br>
My second is a useless expense.<br>
My third is a useless expense.<br>
My fourth is a useless expense.<br>
My fifth is a useless expense.<br>
My sixth is a useless expense,<br>
and so is my eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh, and all the rest<br>
of my parts, of which there are three hundred and fifty.<br>
        <br>
My whole is a useless expense, and sits at Washington." </blockquote>
      <p>The dear little girls were not long in guessing this ingenious
enigma and while they were rejoicing over their success, Mr. P. was
suddenly addressed by a man who had been standing behind him. Starting
little, he turned around and was thus addressed by his unknown listener.</p>
      <img src="images/12a.jpg" align="left" alt="">
      <p>"Sir," said that individual, "do I understand you to mean that
the Congress of the United States is a useless expense?"</p>
      <p>"Well, sir," said Mr. P., with a smile, "as it costs a great
deal and does very little, I cannot but think it is both useless and
expensive."</p>
      <p>"Then sir," said the other, "you must think the whole
institution is a nuisance generally."</p>
      <p>"You put it very strongly," said Mr. P., "but I fear that you
are about right."</p>
      <p>"Sir!" cried the gentleman, his face beaming with an
indescribable expression. "Give me your hand! I am glad to know you. I
agree with you exactly. My name is WHITTEMORE."</p>
      <p>But Mr. P. did not waste all his time in talking to strangers
and concocting enigmas. He had come to Newport with a purpose. It was
none of the ordinary purposes of watering place visitors. These he
could carry out elsewhere.</p>
      <p>His object in coming here was grand, unusual and romantic. <i>He
came to be rescued by IDA LEWIS!</i></p>
      <img src="images/12b.jpg" align="right" alt="">
      <p>It was not easy to devise a plan for this noble design, and it
was not until the morning of the second day of his visit, that Mr. P.
was ready for the adventure. Then he hired a boat, and set sail, alone,
o'er the boundless bosom of the Atlantic.</p>
      <p>He had not sailed more than a few hours on said boundless
bosom, before he turned his prow back towards land,&#8212;towards the
far-famed Lime Rocks, on which the intrepid heroine dwells. He had
thought of being wrecked at night, but fearing that IDA might not be
able to find him in the dark, he gave up this idea. His present
intention was that Miss LEWIS should believe him to be a lonely mariner
from a far distance, tossed by the angry waves upon her rock-bound
coast But there was a certain difficulty in the way, which Mr. P.
feared would prove fatal to his hopes.</p>
      <p>The sea was just as smooth as glass!</p>
      <p>And the wind all died away!</p>
      <p>There was not enough left to ruffle a squirrel's tail. How
absurd the situation! How could he ever be dashed helpless upon the
rocks under such circumstances?</p>
      <p>The tide was setting in, and as he gradually drifted towards
the land, he saw the storied rocks, and even perceived Miss IDA,
sitting upon a shady prominence, crocheting a tidy.</p>
      <p>What should he do to attract her attention? How put himself in
imminent peril? His anxiety for a time was dreadful, but he thought of
a plan. He got out his knife and whittled the mast half through.</p>
      <p>"Now," thought he, "if my mast and rigging go by the board,
she will surely come and rescue me!"</p>
      <p>But the mast and rigging were as obstinate as outside
speculators in Wall street,&#8212;they would not go by the board,&#8212;and Mr. P.
was obliged at last to break down the mast by main force. But the lady
heard not the awful crash, and little weened that a fellow-being was
out alone on the wild watery waste, in a shipwrecked bark! After
waiting for some time, that she might ween this terrible truth, Mr. P,
concluded that there was nothing to do but to spring a leak.</p>
      <p>But he found this difficult. Kick as hard as he might, he
could not loosen a bottom board. And he had no auger! The Lime Rocks
were getting nearer and nearer. Would he drift safely ashore?</p>
      <p>"Oh! how can I wreck myself, 'ere it be too late?" he cried,
in the agony of his heart. Wild with apprehensions of reaching the land
without danger, he sat down and madly whittled a hole in the bottom of
the boat, making it, as nearly as possible, such a one as a sword fish
would be likely to cut. When he got it done, the water bubbled through
it like an oil-well. In fact, Mr. P. was afraid that his vessel would
fill up before he was near enough for the maiden on the rocks to hear
his heart-rending cries for succor. He could see her plainly now. 'Twas
certainly she. He knew her by her photograph&#8212;("Twenty-five cents, sir.
The American female GRACE DARLING, sir. Likeness warranted, sir.")</p>
      <p>But she turned not towards him. Confound it! Would she finish
that eternal tidy ere she glanced around?</p>
      <p>The boat was almost full now. It would sink before she saw it!
That hole must be stopped until he had drifted near enough to give vent
to an agonizing cry for help.</p>
      <p>Having nothing else convenient, Mr. P. clapped into the hole a
lot of manuscripts which he had brought with him for consideration.
(Correspondents who may experience apparent neglect will please take
notice. It is presumed, of course, that every one who writes anything
worth reading, will keep a copy of it.)</p>
      <p>Now the rocks were comparatively near, and standing up to his
knees in water, Mr. P. gave the appropriate heart-rending cry for
succor. But in spite of the prevailing calm, he perceived that there
was a surf upon the rocks, and a noise of many waters. At the top of
his voice Mr. P. again shouted.</p>
      <p>"Hello, IDA!"</p>
      <p>But he soon found that he would have to hello longer as well
as hello IDA, and he did it.</p>
      <p>At last she heard him.</p>
      <p>Dropping her work-basket, she ran to the edge of the rock, and
making a trumpet of her hands, called out:</p>
      <p>"Ahoy there! What's up?"</p>
      <p>"Me!" answered Mr. P., "but I won't be up very long. Haste to
my assistance, oh maiden! ere I sink!"</p>
      <p>Then she shouted again:</p>
      <p>"I've got no boat! It's over to MCCURDY's, getting caulked!"</p>
      <p>No boat!</p>
      <p>Then indeed did Mr. P. turn pale, and his knees did tremble.</p>
      <p>But IDA was not to be daunted. Bounding like a chamois o'er
the rocks, to her house, she quickly returned with a long coil of rope,
and instantly hurled it over the curling breakers with such a strong
arm and true aim, that one end of it struck Mr. P. in the face with a
crack like that of a giant's whip.</p>
      <img src="images/13.jpg" align="left" alt="">
      <p>He grasped the rope, and that instant his boat sank like a
rock!</p>
      <p>IDA hauled away like a steam-engine, and Mr. P.'s prow (his
nose, you know,) cut through the water like a knife, in a straight line
for the shore. In front of him he saw a great mass of sharp roots. He
shuddered, but over them he went. On, on, he went, nor turned aside for
jagged cleft or sharp-edged stone. A ship, loaded with queensware, had
been wrecked near shore, and through a vast mass of broken plates, and
cups, and saucers, Mr. P. went,&#8212;straight and swift as an arrow.</p>
      <p>At last, wet, bleeding, ragged, scratched, and feint, he
reached the shore. Said IDA, as she supported him towards her dwelling:
"How did you ever come to be wrecked on such a day as this?"</p>
      <p>Mr. P. hesitated. But with such a noble creature, the truth
would surely be the best. He told her all.</p>
      <p>"Oh!" said he. "Dear girl, 'twas I, myself, who hewed down my
mast and scuttled my fair bark. And I did it, maiden fair! that thy
brave arm might rescue me from the watery deep, (you know what a good
thing it would be for both of us when it got in the papers,) and that
on thy hardy bosom I might be borne&#8212;"</p>
      <p>"Born jackass!" interrupted IDA. "I believe that everybody who
comes to Newport make fools of themselves about me; but you are
certainly the Champion Fool of the Lime Rocks."</p>
      <p>Mr. P. couldn't deny it.</p>

      <p><b>A Love Tale.</b></p>
      <p><b>I.</b></p>
      <p>"I won't do it&#8212;there!"</p>
      <p>Miss ANGELINA VAVASOUR sat her little fat body down in a
chair, slapped her little fat hands upon her little fat knees, swelled
her little fat person until she looked like a big gooseberry just ready
to burst, and then turned her little fat red face up to Mr. JOHN SMITH,
who was standing before her.</p>
      <p>"I regret," said Mr. J.S., "that you should refuse to be Mrs.
JOHN SMITH." (ANGELINA shuddered.) "Might I ask you why?"</p>
      <p>"No," said she. "Say, my age."</p>
      <p>"But I don't object to that," said J.S.</p>
      <p>"Well, I won't," said ANGELINA, "that's all!"</p>
      <p>J.S. rubbed the fur on his hat the wrong way, pulled up his
shirt collar, looked mournfully at the idol of his heart, and departed.</p>
      <p>Why did she refuse him? Listen!</p>
      <p>About a thousand or two years ago&#8212;well, perhaps we had better
not go so far back&#8212;anyhow, Miss VAVASOUR had ancestors, and she was
proud of them; she had a name, and she gloried in it; she had $100,000,
and therefore insisted on keeping her aristocratic name; she had kept
it for forty years, and was willing to take a contract for the rest of
the job, though she did feel that she needed a man to slide down the
hill of time with her, and she was rather fond of SMITH.</p>
      <p>Mr. JOHN SMITH wanted to marry her for herself alone, though
he had made inquiries and knew all about that $100,000.</p>
      <p>Thus it was.</p>
      <p><b>II.</b></p>
      <p>"That's all!" Miss VAVASOUR had said.</p>
      <p>But was it all? She thought it was matrimony; J.S. thought it
was matter o' money, and J.S. had a long head&#8212;an awfully long head.</p>
      <p>Mr. JOHN SMITH sat before the grate. His auburn locks, his
Roman nose, his little grey eyes, his thin lips, his big ears, and each
particular hair of his red whiskers, expressed intense disgust.</p>
      <p>He was day-dreaming, seeing visions in the fire. There he saw
Miss ANGELINA VAVASOUR. Her eyes were ten dollar gold pieces, her nose
a little pile of ducats, each cheek seemed swelled out by large
quantities of dollars, every tooth in her head was a double-eagle, and
her hair was a mass of ingots. He heaved a sigh and took a fresh chew.</p>
      <p>The tobacco seemed to refresh him; he walked the floor for a
while, and then sat in his chair. Suddenly his countenance was
irradiated, like a ripening squash at early morn, and he sprang to his
feet, crying out, "Eureka! I'll do it."</p>
      <p><b>III.</b></p>
      <p>Eureka! How? What? Thus.</p>
      <p>One month afterwards our hero presented himself at the house
of Miss VAVASOUR, carrying under his arm a large volume, bound in calf.</p>
      <p>"Miss VAVASOUR," said he, "I come to repeat my proposition to
you. Will you reconsider?"</p>
      <p>"Sir?" said she.</p>
      <p>"Things have changed," said our hero.</p>
      <p>"Changed!" echoed she. "What do you mean, Mr. JOHN SMITH?"</p>
      <p>"Call me not by that vile cognomen," quoth he. "Look!" and he
opened the Session Laws at page 1004.</p>
      <p>She read:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"STATE OF NEW YORK, COUNTY OF BLANK.</p>
        <p>I, JONATHAN JERUSALEM, Clerk of said County, do hereby

      <p>She fell into his arms, and rested her palpitating head upon
his palpitating bosom. He pulled up his shirt-collar, trod on the cat,
and gently whispered, "$100,000."</p>

      <p>Here you see Tom, Dick, and Harry, as they looked when
starting in the morning for a day's fishing.</p>
      <p>And this is the same party, dejected, bedraggled, and

      <br>
      <hr style="width: 45%;"> <br>
      <p><b>DOWN THE BAY.</b></p>
      <p>Mr. Punchinello: It is just possible that you never went on a
fine fishing excursion down the Bay with a party of nice young men. If
you never did, don't. I confess it sounds well on paper. But it's a
Deceit, a Snare, and a Hollow Mockery. I will narrate.</p>
      <p>Some days ago I was induced (the Deuce is in it if I ever am
again) to participate in a supposed festivity of this nature. In the
first place, we (the excursionists,) chartered a yacht, two Hands that
knew the Ropes&#8212;they looked as if they might have been acquainted with
the Rope's End&#8212;and a small Octoroon of the male persuasion as waiter.
As CHOWLES characteristically observed, (he is a Stock Broker, and was
one of the party,) "there is nothing like a feeling of Security." So we
engaged a Skipper who was perfectly familiar with the BARINGS of the
Banks, and Thoroughly Posted on all Sea 'Changes, at least so CHOWLES
expressed it, but then he is apt to be somewhat technical at times.
This accomplished mariner was reputed to have been "Round the Horn"
several times, which I am led to believe was perfectly true, as he
smelt strongly of spirits when he came on board. I was much discouraged
at the appearance of this Skipper, and had half a mind to give my
friends the Slip when I saw him on the Wharf.</p>
      <p>Having manned our craft, we purchased a colossal refrigerator
in which to put our Bass and Weak Fish, laid in a stock of cold
provisions&#8212;among other things a Cold Shoulder&#8212;plenty of exhilarating
beverages, and, with Buoyant Spirits, (every Man of us,) and plenty of
ice on board, started on the slack of the Morning Tide. I regret to
state that by the time we were ready to start our Skipper was half way
"Over the Bay," being provided with a pocket pistol charged to the
muzzle. He and his two subordinates were pretty well "Shot in the neck"
by the time we reached Fort Lafoyette. The consequence of this was that
we no sooner came Abreast of the reef in that locality than we got
Afoul of it. For getting Afoul of the Rocks we had to Fork over twenty
dollars to the captain of a tug boat which came and Snaked us off with
a Coil of Rope when the tide rose.</p>
      <p>During the time we remained stationary, the Bottle, I am sorry
to say, kept going Round. All the excursionists except myself got half
seas over, and when we resumed our voyage the steersman had fallen
asleep, so the vessel left a Wake behind her which was extremely
crooked.</p>
      <p>We anchored that night outside Sandy Hook, and next morning
cast our lines overboard, and commenced fishing. Our success in that
Line was astounding, not to say embarrassing. We commenced to take Fish
on an unparalleled Scale. Dog Fish and Stingarees were hauled over the
side without intermission. The former is a kind of small shark. As they
will Swallow anything, we Took them In very fast Although extremely
voracious, they are so simple that if it were not for their size they
would fell an easy prey to the Sea Gull, which, in spite of its name,
is a very Wide Awake bird. Stingarees are fish of much more
Penetration&#8212;their sharp tails slashing everything that comes in their
way. These natural weapons, which have been furnished them by
Providence as a means of defence in their Extremity, cut through a
fellow's trousers like paper. The interesting creatures cut up so that
we kindly consigned them, together with the dog fish, to their native
element, having first benevolently knocked them on the head. Changing
our location for a change of luck, we captured a superb mess of sea
robins and toad fish. This satisfied us. So we pulled up anchor, not
Hankering for any more such sport, and left the Hook, very glad to Hook
It. We didn't have any of our toadies or robbins cooked, as those
"spoils of ocean," although interesting as marine curiosities, are not
considered good to eat, but each man had a Broil, as the Sun was very
hot, and as CHOWLES remarked, "brought out the Gravy." That night we
turned in, having been turned inside out all day. Next morning we
reached home. The skipper presented his Bill in the course of the day.
Although extremely exorbitant, we paid it without a murmur, being too
much exhausted from casting up accounts ourselves, to bring him to Book
for his misconduct. Such is the sad experience of</p>

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Joshua Hutchinson, Steve Schulze and PG Distributed Proofreaders

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use & Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at
http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent
permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.

For additional contact information:
     Dr. Gregory B. Newby
     Chief Executive and Director
     gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234
